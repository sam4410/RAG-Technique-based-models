[ 1 ] While the exploration of space is currently carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes , its physical exploration is conducted both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human spaceflight . Space exploration, like its classical form astronomy , is one of the main sources for space science . While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy , predates reliable recorded history , it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries. [ 2 ] The early era of space exploration was driven by a \" Space Race \" between the Soviet Union and the United States . A driving force of the start of space exploration was during the Cold War. After the ability to create nuclear weapons, the narrative of defense/offense left land and the power to control the air the focus. Both the Soviet Union and the U.S. were racing to prove their superiority in technology through exploring space. In fact, the reason NASA was created was as a response to Sputnik I. [ 3 ] The launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth , the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1 , on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight ( Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1 ) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Alexei Leonov ) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station ( Salyut 1 ) in 1971. After the first 20 years of exploration, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the Space Shuttle program , and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station (ISS). With the substantial completion of the ISS [ 4 ] following STS-133 in March 2011, plans for space exploration by the U.S. remained in flux. The Constellation program aiming for a return to the Moon by 2020 [ 5 ] was judged unrealistic by an expert review panel reporting in 2009. [ 6 ] Constellation ultimately was replaced with the Artemis Program , of which the first mission occurred in 2022 , with a planned crewed landing to occur with Artemis III . [ 7 ] The rise of the private space industry also began in earnest in the 2010s with the development of private launch vehicles, space capsules and satellite manufacturing. In the 2000s, China initiated a successful crewed spaceflight program while India launched the Chandrayaan programme , while the European Union and Japan have also planned future crewed space missions. The two primary global programs gaining traction in the 2020s are the Chinese-led International Lunar Research Station and the US-led Artemis Program, with its plan to build the Lunar Gateway and the Artemis Base Camp , each having its own set of international partners. History of exploration [ edit ] See also: History of astronomy , Discovery and exploration of the Solar System , Timeline of space exploration , Timeline of first orbital launches by country , and Outer space § Discovery V-2 Rocket in the Peenemünde Museum First telescopes [ edit ] The first telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 in the Netherlands by an eyeglass maker named Hans Lippershey , but their first recorded use in astronomy was by Galileo Galilei in 1609. [ 8 ] In 1668 Isaac Newton built his own reflecting telescope , the first fully functional telescope of this kind, and a landmark for future developments due to its superior features over the previous Galilean telescope . [ 9 ] A string of discoveries in the Solar System (and beyond) followed, then and in the next centuries : the mountains of the Moon , the phases of Venus , the main satellites of Jupiter and Saturn , the rings of Saturn , many comets , the asteroids , the new planets Uranus and Neptune , and many more satellites . The Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 2 was the first space telescope launched 1968, [ 10 ] but the launching of Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 [ 11 ] set a milestone. As of 1 December 2022, there were 5,284 confirmed exoplanets discovered. The Milky Way is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars [ 12 ] and more than 100 billion planets . [ 13 ] There are at least 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] HD1 is the most distant known object from Earth, reported as 33.4 billion light-years away. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] First outer space flights [ edit ] Model of Vostok spacecraft Apollo Command Service Module in lunar orbit MW 18014 was a German V-2 rocket test launch that took place on 20 June 1944, at the Peenemünde Army Research Center in Peenemünde . It was the first human-made object to reach outer space , attaining an apogee of 176 kilometers, [ 22 ] which is well above the Kármán line . [ 23 ] It was a vertical test launch. Although the rocket reached space, it did not reach orbital velocity , and therefore returned to Earth in an impact, becoming the first sub-orbital spaceflight . [ 24 ] In 1949, the Bumper-WAC reached an altitude of 393 kilometres (244 mi), becoming the first human-made object to enter space, according to NASA . [ 25 ] First object in orbit [ edit ] The first successful orbital launch was of the Soviet uncrewed Sputnik 1 (\"Satellite 1\") mission on 4 October 1957. The satellite weighed about 83 kg (183 lb), and is believed to have orbited Earth at a height of about 250 km (160 mi). It had two radio transmitters (20 and 40 MHz), which emitted \"beeps\" that could be heard by radios around the globe. Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere, while temperature and pressure data was encoded in the duration of radio beeps. The results indicated that the satellite was not punctured by a meteoroid . Sputnik 1 was launched by an R-7 rocket. It burned up upon re-entry on 3 January 1958. First human outer space flight [ edit ] The first successful human spaceflight was Vostok 1 (\"East 1\"), carrying the 27-year-old Russian cosmonaut , Yuri Gagarin , on 12 April 1961. The spacecraft completed one orbit around the globe, lasting about 1 hour and 48 minutes. Gagarin's flight resonated around the world; it was a demonstration of the advanced Soviet space program and it opened an entirely new era in space exploration: human spaceflight . First astronomical body space explorations [ edit ] The first artificial object to reach another celestial body was Luna 2 reaching the Moon in 1959. [ 26 ] The first soft landing on another celestial body was performed by Luna 9 landing on the Moon on 3 February 1966. [ 27 ] Luna 10 became the first artificial satellite of the Moon, entering in a lunar orbit on 3 April 1966. [ 28 ] The first crewed landing on another celestial body was performed by Apollo 11 on 20 July 1969, landing on the Moon. There have been a total of six spacecraft with humans landing on the Moon starting from 1969 to the last human landing in 1972. The first interplanetary flyby was the 1961 Venera 1 flyby of Venus , though the 1962 Mariner 2 was the first flyby of Venus to return data (closest approach 34,773 kilometers). Pioneer 6 was the first satellite to orbit the Sun , launched on 16 December 1965. The other planets were first flown by in 1965 for Mars by Mariner 4 , 1973 for Jupiter by Pioneer 10 , 1974 for Mercury by Mariner 10 , 1979 for Saturn by Pioneer 11 , 1986 for Uranus by Voyager 2 , 1989 for Neptune by Voyager 2 . In 2015, the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto were orbited by Dawn and passed by New Horizons , respectively. This accounts for flybys of each of the eight planets in the Solar System , the Sun , the Moon , and Ceres and Pluto (two of the five recognized dwarf planets ). The first interplanetary surface mission to return at least limited surface data from another planet was the 1970 landing of Venera 7 , which returned data to Earth for 23 minutes from Venus . In 1975, Venera 9 was the first to return images from the surface of another planet, returning images from Venus. In 1971, the Mars 3 mission achieved the first soft landing on Mars returning data for almost 20 seconds. Later, much longer duration surface missions were achieved, including over six years of Mars surface operation by Viking 1 from 1975 to 1982 and over two hours of transmission from the surface of Venus by Venera 13 in 1982, the longest ever Soviet planetary surface mission. Venus and Mars are the two planets outside of Earth on which humans have conducted surface missions with uncrewed robotic spacecraft . First space station [ edit ] Salyut 1 was the first space station of any kind, launched into low Earth orbit by the Soviet Union on 19 April 1971. The International Space Station (ISS) is currently the largest and oldest of the 2 current fully functional space stations, inhabited continuously since the year 2000. The other, Tiangong space station built by China, is now fully crewed and operational. First interstellar space flight [ edit ] Voyager 1 became the first human-made object to leave the Solar System into interstellar space on 25 August 2012. The probe passed the heliopause at 121 AU to enter interstellar space . [ 29 ] Farthest from Earth [ edit ] The Apollo 13 flight passed the far side of the Moon at an altitude of 254 kilometers (158 miles; 137 nautical miles) above the lunar surface, and 400,171 km (248,655 mi) from Earth, marking the record for the farthest humans have ever traveled from Earth in 1970. As of 9 February 2025 [update] Voyager 1 was at a distance of 166.4 AU (24.89 billion km; 15.47 billion mi) from Earth. [ 30 ] It is the most distant human-made object from Earth. [ 31 ] Targets of exploration [ edit ] Starting in the mid-20th century probes and then human missions were sent into Earth orbit, and then on to the Moon. Also, probes were sent throughout the known Solar System, and into Solar orbit. Uncrewed spacecraft have been sent into orbit around Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury by the 21st century, and the most distance active spacecraft, Voyager 1 and 2 traveled beyond 100 times the Earth-Sun distance. The instruments were enough though that it is thought they have left the Sun's heliosphere, a sort of bubble of particles made in the Galaxy by the Sun's solar wind . The Sun [ edit ] The Sun is a major focus of space exploration. Being above the atmosphere in particular and Earth's magnetic field gives access to the solar wind and infrared and ultraviolet radiations that cannot reach Earth's surface. The Sun generates most space weather , which can affect power generation and transmission systems on Earth and interfere with, and even damage, satellites and space probes. Numerous spacecraft dedicated to observing the Sun, beginning with the Apollo Telescope Mount , have been launched and still others have had solar observation as a secondary objective. Parker Solar Probe , launched in 2018, will approach the Sun to within 1/9th the orbit of Mercury. Mercury [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Mercury A MESSENGER image from 18,000 km showing a region about 500 km across (2008) Mercury remains the least explored of the Terrestrial planets . As of May 2013, the Mariner 10 and MESSENGER missions have been the only missions that have made close observations of Mercury. MESSENGER entered orbit around Mercury in March 2011, to further investigate the observations made by Mariner 10 in 1975 (Munsell, 2006b). A third mission to Mercury, scheduled to arrive in 2025, BepiColombo is to include two probes . BepiColombo is a joint mission between Japan and the European Space Agency . MESSENGER and BepiColombo are intended to gather complementary data to help scientists understand many of the mysteries discovered by Mariner 10's flybys . Flights to other planets within the Solar System are accomplished at a cost in energy, which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft, or delta-v . Due to the relatively high delta-v to reach Mercury and its proximity to the Sun, it is difficult to explore and orbits around it are rather unstable. Venus [ edit ] Main article: Observations and explorations of Venus Venus was the first target of interplanetary flyby and lander missions and, despite one of the most hostile surface environments in the Solar System, has had more landers sent to it (nearly all from the Soviet Union) than any other planet in the Solar System. The first flyby was the 1961 Venera 1 , though the 1962 Mariner 2 was the first flyby to successfully return data. Mariner 2 has been followed by several other flybys by multiple space agencies often as part of missions using a Venus flyby to provide a gravitational assist en route to other celestial bodies. In 1967, Venera 4 became the first probe to enter and directly examine the atmosphere of Venus. In 1970, Venera 7 became the first successful lander to reach the surface of Venus and by 1985 it had been followed by eight additional successful Soviet Venus landers which provided images and other direct surface data. Starting in 1975, with the Soviet orbiter Venera 9 , some ten successful orbiter missions have been sent to Venus, including later missions which were able to map the surface of Venus using radar to pierce the obscuring atmosphere. Earth [ edit ] Main article: Earth observation satellite First television image of Earth from space, taken by TIROS-1 (1960) Space exploration has been used as a tool to understand Earth as a celestial object. Orbital missions can provide data for Earth that can be difficult or impossible to obtain from a purely ground-based point of reference. For example, the existence of the Van Allen radiation belts was unknown until their discovery by the United States' first artificial satellite, Explorer 1 . These belts contain radiation trapped by Earth's magnetic fields, which currently renders construction of habitable space stations above 1000 km impractical. Following this early unexpected discovery, a large number of Earth observation satellites have been deployed specifically to explore Earth from a space-based perspective. These satellites have significantly contributed to the understanding of a variety of Earth-based phenomena. For instance, the hole in the ozone layer was found by an artificial satellite that was exploring Earth's atmosphere, and satellites have allowed for the discovery of archeological sites or geological formations that were difficult or impossible to otherwise identify. Moon [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of the Moon Apollo 16 LEM Orion, the Lunar Roving Vehicle and astronaut John Young (1972) The Moon was the first celestial body to be the object of space exploration. It holds the distinctions of being the first remote celestial object to be flown by, orbited, and landed upon by spacecraft, and the only remote celestial object ever to be visited by humans. In 1959, the Soviets obtained the first images of the far side of the Moon , never previously visible to humans. The U.S. exploration of the Moon began with the Ranger 4 impactor in 1962. Starting in 1966, the Soviets successfully deployed a number of landers to the Moon which were able to obtain data directly from the Moon's surface; just four months later, Surveyor 1 marked the debut of a successful series of U.S. landers. The Soviet uncrewed missions culminated in the Lunokhod program in the early 1970s, which included the first uncrewed rovers and also successfully brought lunar soil samples to Earth for study. This marked the first (and to date the only) automated return of extraterrestrial soil samples to Earth. Uncrewed exploration of the Moon continues with various nations periodically deploying lunar orbiters. China's Chang'e 4 in 2019 and Chang'e 6 in 2024 achieved the world's first landing and sample return on the far side of the Moon . India's Chandrayaan-3 in 2023 achieved the world's first landing on the lunar south pole region. Crewed exploration of the Moon began in 1968 with the Apollo 8 mission that successfully orbited the Moon, the first time any extraterrestrial object was orbited by humans. In 1969, the Apollo 11 mission marked the first time humans set foot upon another world. Crewed exploration of the Moon did not continue for long. The Apollo 17 mission in 1972 marked the sixth landing and the most recent human visit. Artemis II is scheduled to complete a crewed flyby of the Moon in 2025, and Artemis III will perform the first lunar landing since Apollo 17 with it scheduled for launch no earlier than 2026. Robotic missions are still pursued vigorously. Mars [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Mars Surface of Mars by the Spirit rover (2004) The exploration of Mars has been an important part of the space exploration programs of the Soviet Union (later Russia), the United States, Europe, Japan and India. Dozens of robotic spacecraft , including orbiters , landers , and rovers , have been launched toward Mars since the 1960s. These missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the history of Mars. The questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the Red Planet but also yield further insight into the past, and possible future, of Earth. The exploration of Mars has come at a considerable financial cost with roughly two-thirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars failing before completing their missions, with some failing before they even began. Such a high failure rate can be attributed to the complexity and large number of variables involved in an interplanetary journey, and has led researchers to jokingly speak of The Great Galactic Ghoul [ 32 ] which subsists on a diet of Mars probes. This phenomenon is also informally known as the \" Mars Curse \". [ 33 ] In contrast to overall high failure rates in the exploration of Mars, India has become the first country to achieve success of its maiden attempt. India's Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] is one of the least expensive interplanetary missions ever undertaken with an approximate total cost of ₹ 450 Crore ( US$73 million ). [ 37 ] [ 38 ] The first mission to Mars by any Arab country has been taken up by the United Arab Emirates. Called the Emirates Mars Mission , it was launched on 19 July 2020 and went into orbit around Mars on 9 February 2021. The uncrewed exploratory probe was named \"Hope Probe\" and was sent to Mars to study its atmosphere in detail. [ 39 ] Phobos [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Phobos The Russian space mission Fobos-Grunt , which launched on 9 November 2011, experienced a failure leaving it stranded in low Earth orbit . [ 40 ] It was to begin exploration of the Phobos and Martian circumterrestrial orbit, and study whether the moons of Mars, or at least Phobos, could be a \"trans-shipment point\" for spaceships traveling to Mars. [ 41 ] Asteroids [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of the asteroids Asteroid 4 Vesta , imaged by the Dawn spacecraft (2011) Until the advent of space travel , objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes, their shapes and terrain remaining a mystery. Several asteroids have now been visited by probes, the first of which was Galileo , which flew past two: 951 Gaspra in 1991, followed by 243 Ida in 1993. Both of these lay near enough to Galileo' s planned trajectory to Jupiter that they could be visited at acceptable cost. The first landing on an asteroid was performed by the NEAR Shoemaker probe in 2000, following an orbital survey of the object, 433 Eros . The dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroid 4 Vesta , two of the three largest asteroids, were visited by NASA's Dawn spacecraft , launched in 2007. Hayabusa was a robotic spacecraft developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency to return a sample of material from the small near-Earth asteroid 25143 Itokawa to Earth for further analysis. Hayabusa was launched on 9 May 2003 and rendezvoused with Itokawa in mid-September 2005. After arriving at Itokawa, Hayabusa studied the asteroid's shape, spin, topography, color, composition, density, and history. In November 2005, it landed on the asteroid twice to collect samples. The spacecraft returned to Earth on 13 June 2010. Jupiter [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Jupiter Tupan Patera on Jupiter's moon Io The exploration of Jupiter has consisted solely of a number of automated NASA spacecraft visiting the planet since 1973. A large majority of the missions have been \"flybys\", in which detailed observations are taken without the probe landing or entering orbit; such as in Pioneer and Voyager programs. The Galileo and Juno spacecraft are the only spacecraft to have entered the planet's orbit. As Jupiter is believed to have only a relatively small rocky core and no real solid surface, a landing mission is precluded. Reaching Jupiter from Earth requires a delta-v of 9.2 km/s, [ 42 ] which is comparable to the 9.7 km/s delta-v needed to reach low Earth orbit. [ 43 ] Fortunately, gravity assists through planetary flybys can be used to reduce the energy required at launch to reach Jupiter, albeit at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration. [ 42 ] Jupiter has 95 known moons , many of which have relatively little known information about them. Saturn [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Saturn Saturn has been explored only through uncrewed spacecraft launched by NASA, including one mission ( Cassini–Huygens ) planned and executed in cooperation with other space agencies. These missions consist of flybys in 1979 by Pioneer 11 , in 1980 by Voyager 1 , in 1982 by Voyager 2 and an orbital mission by the Cassini spacecraft, which lasted from 2004 until 2017. Saturn has at least 62 known moons , although the exact number is debatable since Saturn's rings are made up of vast numbers of independently orbiting objects of varying sizes. The largest of the moons is Titan , which holds the distinction of being the only moon in the Solar System with an atmosphere denser and thicker than that of Earth. Titan holds the distinction of being the only object in the Outer Solar System that has been explored with a lander, the Huygens probe deployed by the Cassini spacecraft. Uranus [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Uranus The exploration of Uranus has been entirely through the Voyager 2 spacecraft, with no other visits currently planned. Given its axial tilt of 97.77°, with its polar regions exposed to sunlight or darkness for long periods, scientists were not sure what to expect at Uranus. The closest approach to Uranus occurred on 24 January 1986. Voyager 2 studied the planet's unique atmosphere and magnetosphere . Voyager 2 also examined its ring system and the moons of Uranus including all five of the previously known moons, while discovering an additional ten previously unknown moons. Images of Uranus proved to have a uniform appearance, with no evidence of the dramatic storms or atmospheric banding evident on Jupiter and Saturn. Great effort was required to even identify a few clouds in the images of the planet. The magnetosphere of Uranus, however, proved to be unique, being profoundly affected by the planet's unusual axial tilt. In contrast to the bland appearance of Uranus itself, striking images were obtained of the Moons of Uranus, including evidence that Miranda had been unusually geologically active. Neptune [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Neptune The exploration of Neptune began with the 25 August 1989 Voyager 2 flyby, the sole visit to the system as of 2025. The possibility of a Neptune Orbiter has been discussed, but no other missions have been given serious thought. Although the extremely uniform appearance of Uranus during Voyager 2 ' s visit in 1986 had led to expectations that Neptune would also have few visible atmospheric phenomena, the spacecraft found that Neptune had obvious banding, visible clouds, auroras , and even a conspicuous anticyclone storm system rivaled in size only by Jupiter's Great Red Spot . Neptune also proved to have the fastest winds of any planet in the Solar System, measured as high as 2,100 km/h. [ 44 ] Voyager 2 also examined Neptune's ring and moon system . It discovered 900 complete rings and additional partial ring \"arcs\" around Neptune. In addition to examining Neptune's three previously known moons, Voyager 2 also discovered five previously unknown moons, one of which, Proteus , proved to be the last largest moon in the system. Data from Voyager 2 supported the view that Neptune's largest moon, Triton , is a captured Kuiper belt object. [ 45 ] Pluto [ edit ] Main article: Pluto § Exploration The dwarf planet Pluto presents significant challenges for spacecraft because of its great distance from Earth (requiring high velocity for reasonable trip times) and small mass (making capture into orbit difficult at present). Voyager 1 could have visited Pluto, but controllers opted instead for a close flyby of Saturn's moon Titan, resulting in a trajectory incompatible with a Pluto flyby. Voyager 2 never had a plausible trajectory for reaching Pluto. [ 46 ] After an intense political battle, a mission to Pluto dubbed New Horizons was granted funding from the United States government in 2003. [ 47 ] New Horizons was launched successfully on 19 January 2006. In early 2007 the craft made use of a gravity assist from Jupiter . Its closest approach to Pluto was on 14 July 2015; scientific observations of Pluto began five months prior to closest approach and continued for 16 days after the encounter. Kuiper Belt Objects [ edit ] The New Horizons mission also performed a flyby of the small planetesimal Arrokoth , in the Kuiper belt , in 2019. This was its first extended mission. [ 48 ] Comets [ edit ] Main article: List of missions to comets Comet 103P/Hartley (2010) Although many comets have been studied from Earth sometimes with centuries-worth of observations, only a few comets have been closely visited. In 1985, the International Cometary Explorer conducted the first comet fly-by ( 21P/Giacobini-Zinner ) before joining the Halley Armada studying the famous comet. The Deep Impact probe smashed into 9P/Tempel to learn more about its structure and composition and the Stardust mission returned samples of another comet's tail. The Philae lander successfully landed on Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko in 2014 as part of the broader Rosetta mission . Deep space exploration [ edit ] Main article: Deep space exploration This high-resolution image of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field includes galaxies of various ages, sizes, shapes, and colors. The smallest, reddest galaxies, are some of the most distant galaxies to have been imaged by an optical telescope. Deep space exploration is the branch of astronomy , astronautics and space technology that is involved with the exploration of distant regions of outer space. [ 49 ] Physical exploration of space is conducted both by human spaceflights (deep-space astronautics) and by robotic spacecraft . Some of the best candidates for future deep space engine technologies include anti-matter , nuclear power and beamed propulsion . [ 50 ] Beamed propulsion, appears to be the best candidate for deep space exploration presently available, since it uses known physics and known technology that is being developed for other purposes. [ 51 ] Future of space exploration [ edit ] Main article: Future of space exploration Concept art for a NASA Vision mission Artistic image of a rocket lifting from a Saturn moon Breakthrough Starshot [ edit ] Main article: Breakthrough Starshot Breakthrough Starshot is a research and engineering project by the Breakthrough Initiatives to develop a proof-of-concept fleet of light sail spacecraft named StarChip , [ 52 ] to be capable of making the journey to the Alpha Centauri star system 4.37 light-years away. It was founded in 2016 by Yuri Milner , Stephen Hawking , and Mark Zuckerberg . [ 53 ] [ 54 ] Asteroids [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of the asteroids An article in the science magazine Nature suggested the use of asteroids as a gateway for space exploration, with the ultimate destination being Mars. In order to make such an approach viable, three requirements need to be fulfilled: first, \"a thorough asteroid survey to find thousands of nearby bodies suitable for astronauts to visit\"; second, \"extending flight duration and distance capability to ever-increasing ranges out to Mars\"; and finally, \"developing better robotic vehicles and tools to enable astronauts to explore an asteroid regardless of its size, shape or spin\". Furthermore, using asteroids would provide astronauts with protection from galactic cosmic rays, with mission crews being able to land on them without great risk to radiation exposure. Artemis program [ edit ] Main article: Artemis program The Artemis program is an ongoing crewed spaceflight program carried out by NASA , U.S. commercial spaceflight companies , and international partners such as ESA , [ 55 ] with the goal of landing \"the first woman and the next man\" on the Moon, specifically at the lunar south pole region. Artemis would be the next step towards the long-term goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon, laying the foundation for private companies to build a lunar economy, and eventually sending humans to Mars . In 2017, the lunar campaign was authorized by Space Policy Directive 1 , using various ongoing spacecraft programs such as Orion , the Lunar Gateway , Commercial Lunar Payload Services , and adding an undeveloped crewed lander. The Space Launch System will serve as the primary launch vehicle for Orion, while commercial launch vehicles are planned for use to launch other elements of the campaign. [ 56 ] NASA requested $1.6 billion in additional funding for Artemis for fiscal year 2020, [ 57 ] while the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee requested from NASA a five-year budget profile [ 58 ] which is needed for evaluation and approval by the U.S. Congress . [ 59 ] [ 60 ] As of 2024, the first Artemis mission was launched in 2022 with the second mission, a crewed lunar flyby planned for 2025. [ 61 ] Construction on the Lunar Gateway is underway with initial capabilities set for the 2025–2027 timeframe. [ 62 ] The first CLPS lander landed in 2024, marking the first US spacecraft to land since Apollo 17 . [ 63 ] Rationales [ edit ] Main article: Space advocacy Astronaut Buzz Aldrin had a personal Communion service when he first arrived on the surface of the Moon . The research that is conducted by national space exploration agencies, such as NASA and Roscosmos , is one of the reasons supporters cite to justify government expenses. Economic analyses of the NASA programs often showed ongoing economic benefits (such as NASA spin-offs ), generating many times the revenue of the cost of the program. [ 64 ] It is also argued that space exploration would lead to the extraction of resources on other planets and especially asteroids, which contain billions of dollars worth of minerals and metals. Such expeditions could generate substantial revenue. [ 65 ] In addition, it has been argued that space exploration programs help inspire youth to study in science and engineering. [ 66 ] Space exploration also gives scientists the ability to perform experiments in other settings and expand humanity's knowledge. [ 67 ] Another claim is that space exploration is a necessity to humankind and that staying on Earth will eventually lead to extinction . Some of the reasons are lack of natural resources, comets, nuclear war, and worldwide epidemic. Stephen Hawking , renowned British theoretical physicist, said, \"I don't think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet. But I'm an optimist. We will reach out to the stars.\" [ 68 ] Author Arthur C. Clarke (1950) presented a summary of motivations for the human exploration of space in his non-fiction semi-technical monograph Interplanetary Flight . [ 69 ] He argued that humanity's choice is essentially between expansion off Earth into space, versus cultural (and eventually biological) stagnation and death. These motivations could be attributed to one of the first rocket scientists in NASA, Wernher von Braun , and his vision of humans moving beyond Earth. The basis of this plan was to: Develop multi-stage rockets capable of placing satellites, animals, and humans in space. Development of large, winged reusable spacecraft capable of carrying humans and equipment into Earth orbit in a way that made space access routine and cost-effective. Construction of a large, permanently occupied space station to be used as a platform both to observe Earth and from which to launch deep space expeditions. Launching the first human flights around the Moon, leading to the first landings of humans on the Moon, with the intent of exploring that body and establishing permanent lunar bases. Assembly and fueling of spaceships in Earth orbit for the purpose of sending humans to Mars with the intent of eventually colonizing that planet. [ 70 ] Known as the Von Braun Paradigm, the plan was formulated to lead humans in the exploration of space. Von Braun's vision of human space exploration served as the model for efforts in space exploration well into the twenty-first century, with NASA incorporating this approach into the majority of their projects. [ 70 ] The steps were followed out of order, as seen by the Apollo program reaching the moon before the space shuttle program was started, which in turn was used to complete the International Space Station. Von Braun's Paradigm formed NASA's drive for human exploration, in the hopes that humans discover the far reaches of the universe. NASA has produced a series of public service announcement videos supporting the concept of space exploration. [ 71 ] Overall, the U.S. public remains largely supportive of both crewed and uncrewed space exploration. According to an Associated Press Poll conducted in July 2003, 71% of U.S. citizens agreed with the statement that the space program is \"a good investment\", compared to 21% who did not. [ 72 ] Human nature [ edit ] Space advocacy and space policy [ 73 ] regularly invokes exploration as a human nature . [ 74 ] Topics [ edit ] Main articles: Space science and Human presence in space Spaceflight [ edit ] Main articles: Spaceflight and Astronautics Delta-v's in km/s for various orbital maneuvers Spaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space. Spaceflight is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite telecommunications . Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories , reconnaissance satellites and other Earth observation satellites . A spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch , which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of Earth. Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics . Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry , and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact. Satellites [ edit ] Main article: Satellite Satellites are used for a large number of purposes. Common types include military (spy) and civilian Earth observation satellites, communication satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and research satellites. Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites. Commercialization of space [ edit ] Main article: Commercialization of space The commercialization of space first started out with the launching of private satellites by NASA or other space agencies. Current examples of the commercial satellite use of space include satellite navigation systems , satellite television, satellite communications (such as internet services) and satellite radio . The next step of commercialization of space was seen as human spaceflight. Flying humans safely to and from space had become routine to NASA and Russia. [ 75 ] Reusable spacecraft were an entirely new engineering challenge, something only seen in novels and films like Star Trek and War of the Worlds. Astronaut Buzz Aldrin supported the use of making a reusable vehicle like the space shuttle. Aldrin held that reusable spacecraft were the key in making space travel affordable, stating that the use of \"passenger space travel is a huge potential market big enough to justify the creation of reusable launch vehicles\". [ 76 ] Space tourism is a next step in the use of reusable vehicles in the commercialization of space. The purpose of this form of space travel is personal pleasure. Private spaceflight companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin , and commercial space stations such as the Axiom Space and the Bigelow Commercial Space Station have changed the cost and overall landscape of space exploration, and are expected to continue to do so in the near future. Alien life [ edit ] Main articles: Astrobiology and Extraterrestrial life Astrobiology is the interdisciplinary study of life in the universe, combining aspects of astronomy , biology and geology. [ 77 ] It is focused primarily on the study of the origin , distribution and evolution of life. It is also known as exobiology (from Greek: έξω, exo , \"outside\"). [ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] The term \"Xenobiology\" has been used as well, but this is technically incorrect because its terminology means \"biology of the foreigners\". [ 81 ] Astrobiologists must also consider the possibility of life that is chemically entirely distinct from any life found on Earth. [ 82 ] In the Solar System, some of the prime locations for current or past astrobiology are on Enceladus, Europa, Mars, and Titan. [ 83 ] Human spaceflight and habitation [ edit ] Main articles: Human spaceflight , Bioastronautics , Effect of spaceflight on the human body , Space medicine , Space architecture , Space station , Space habitat (facility) , and Space habitat (settlement) Crew quarters on Zvezda , the base ISS crew module To date, the longest human occupation of space is the International Space Station which has been in continuous use for 24 years, 130 days. Valeri Polyakov 's record single spaceflight of almost 438 days aboard the Mir space station has not been surpassed. The health effects of space have been well documented through years of research conducted in the field of aerospace medicine . Analog environments similar to those experienced in space travel (like deep sea submarines), have been used in this research to further explore the relationship between isolation and extreme environments. [ 84 ] It is imperative that the health of the crew be maintained as any deviation from baseline may compromise the integrity of the mission as well as the safety of the crew, hence the astronauts must endure rigorous medical screenings and tests prior to embarking on any missions. However, it does not take long for the environmental dynamics of spaceflight to commence its toll on the human body; for example, space motion sickness (SMS) – a condition which affects the neurovestibular system and culminates in mild to severe signs and symptoms such as vertigo, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and disorientation – plagues almost all space travelers within their first few days in orbit. [ 84 ] Space travel can also have an impact on the psyche of the crew members as delineated in anecdotal writings composed after their retirement. Space travel can adversely affect the body's natural biological clock ( circadian rhythm ); sleep patterns causing sleep deprivation and fatigue; and social interaction; consequently, residing in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) environment for a prolonged amount of time can result in both mental and physical exhaustion. [ 84 ] Long-term stays in space reveal issues with bone and muscle loss in low gravity, immune system suppression, problems with eyesight, and radiation exposure. The lack of gravity causes fluid to rise upward which can cause pressure to build up in the eye, resulting in vision problems; the loss of bone minerals and densities; cardiovascular deconditioning; and decreased endurance and muscle mass. [ 85 ] Radiation is an insidious health hazard to space travelers as it is invisible and can cause cancer. When above the Earth's magnetic field, spacecraft are no longer protected from the sun's radiation; the danger of radiation is even more potent in deep space. The hazards of radiation can be ameliorated through protective shielding on the spacecraft, alerts, and dosimetry . [ 86 ] Fortunately, with new and rapidly evolving technological advancements, those in Mission Control are able to monitor the health of their astronauts more closely using telemedicine . One may not be able to completely evade the physiological effects of space flight, but those effects can be mitigated. For example, medical systems aboard space vessels such as the International Space Station (ISS) are well equipped and designed to counteract the effects of lack of gravity and weightlessness; on-board treadmills can help prevent muscle loss and reduce the risk of developing premature osteoporosis . [ 84 ] [ 86 ] Additionally, a crew medical officer is appointed for each ISS mission and a flight surgeon is available 24/7 via the ISS Mission Control Center located in Houston, Texas. [ 86 ] Although the interactions are intended to take place in real time, communications between the space and terrestrial crew may become delayed – sometimes by as much as 20 minutes [ 86 ] – as their distance from each other increases when the spacecraft moves further out of low Earth orbit; because of this the crew are trained and need to be prepared to respond to any medical emergencies that may arise on the vessel as the ground crew are hundreds of miles away. Many past and current concepts for the continued exploration and colonization of space focus on a return to the Moon as a \"steppingstone\" to the other planets, especially Mars. At the end of 2006, NASA announced they were planning to build a permanent Moon base with continual presence by 2024. [ 87 ] Beyond the technical factors that could make living in space more widespread, it has been suggested that the lack of private property , the inability or difficulty in establishing property rights in space, has been an impediment to the development of space for human habitation. Since the advent of space technology in the latter half of the twentieth century, the ownership of property in space has been murky, with strong arguments both for and against. In particular, the making of national territorial claims in outer space and on celestial bodies has been specifically proscribed by the Outer Space Treaty , which had been, as of 2012 [update] , ratified by all spacefaring nations . [ 88 ] Space colonization, also called space settlement and space humanization, would be the permanent autonomous (self-sufficient) human habitation of locations outside Earth, especially of natural satellites or planets such as the Moon or Mars , using significant amounts of in-situ resource utilization . Human representation and participation [ edit ] See also: Space law Participation and representation of humanity in space is an issue ever since the first phase of space exploration. [ 89 ] Some rights of non-spacefaring countries have been mostly secured through international space law , declaring space the \" province of all mankind \", understanding spaceflight as its resource, though sharing of space for all humanity is still criticized as imperialist and lacking. [ 89 ] Additionally to international inclusion, the inclusion of women and people of colour has also been lacking. To reach a more inclusive spaceflight, some organizations like the Justspace Alliance [ 89 ] and IAU featured Inclusive Astronomy [ 90 ] have been formed in recent years. Women [ edit ] Main article: Women in space The first woman to go to space was Valentina Tereshkova . She flew in 1963 but it was not until the 1980s that another woman entered space again. All astronauts were required to be military test pilots at the time and women were not able to join this career. This is one reason for the delay in allowing women to join space crews. [ 91 ] After the rule changed, Svetlana Savitskaya became the second woman to go to space, she was also from the Soviet Union . Sally Ride became the next woman in space and the first woman to fly to space through the United States program. Since then, eleven other countries have allowed women astronauts. The first all-female space walk occurred in 2018, including Christina Koch and Jessica Meir . They had both previously participated in space walks with NASA. The first woman to go to the Moon is planned for 2026. Despite these developments, women are underrepresented among astronauts and especially cosmonauts. Issues that block potential applicants from the programs, and limit the space missions they are able to go on, include: agencies limiting women to half as much time in space than men, arguing that there may be unresearched additional risks for cancer. [ 92 ] a lack of space suits sized appropriately for female astronauts. [ 93 ] Art [ edit ] See also: Space art § Art in space Artistry in and from space ranges from signals, capturing and arranging material like Yuri Gagarin 's selfie in space or the image The Blue Marble , over drawings like the first one in space by cosmonaut and artist Alexei Leonov , music videos like Chris Hadfield's cover of Space Oddity on board the ISS, to permanent installations on celestial bodies like on the Moon .

It was built by Lockheed Martin and is operated by NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory . The spacecraft was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on August 5, 2011 UTC , as part of the New Frontiers program . [ 6 ] Juno entered a polar orbit of Jupiter on July 5, 2016, UTC, [ 4 ] [ 7 ] to begin a scientific investigation of the planet. [ 8 ] After completing its mission, Juno was originally planned to be intentionally deorbited into Jupiter's atmosphere, [ 8 ] but has since been approved to continue orbiting until contact is lost with the spacecraft. Juno 's mission is to measure Jupiter's composition, gravitational field , magnetic field , and polar magnetosphere . It also searches for clues about how the planet formed, including whether it has a rocky core, the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere, mass distribution , and its deep winds, which can reach speeds up to 620 km/h (390 mph). [ 9 ] Juno is the second spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, after the nuclear powered Galileo orbiter , which orbited from 1995 to 2003. Unlike all earlier spacecraft sent to the outer Solar System and beyond—which used radioisotope thermoelectric generators for power— Juno is powered by solar panels , more commonly used by satellites orbiting Earth and working in the inner Solar System . [ 8 ] Accordingly, Juno required the three largest solar panel wings ever deployed on a planetary probe (at the time of launching). These play an integral role in stabilizing the spacecraft as well as generating power. [ 10 ] Naming [ edit ] Juno 's name comes from Greek and Roman mythology . The god Jupiter drew a veil of clouds around himself to hide his mischief, and his wife, the goddess Juno , was able to peer through the clouds and reveal Jupiter's true nature. — NASA [ 11 ] A NASA compilation of mission names and acronyms referred to the mission by the backronym Jupiter Near-polar Orbiter . [ 12 ] However the project itself has consistently described it as a name with mythological associations [ 13 ] and not an acronym. The spacecraft's current name is in reference to the Roman goddess Juno . [ 11 ] Juno is sometimes called the New Frontiers 2 as the second mission in the New Frontiers program, [ 14 ] [ 15 ] but is not to be confused with New Horizons 2 , a proposed but unselected New Frontiers mission. Overview [ edit ] Juno 's interplanetary trajectory; tick marks at 30-day intervals. Juno spacecraft trajectory animation Animation of Juno 's trajectory from August 5, 2011 Juno · Earth · Mars · Jupiter Juno was selected on June 9, 2005, as the next New Frontiers mission after New Horizons . [ 16 ] The desire for a Jupiter probe was strong in the years prior to this, but there had not been any approved missions. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] The Discovery Program had passed over the somewhat similar but more limited Interior Structure and Internal Dynamical Evolution of Jupiter (INSIDE Jupiter) proposal, [ 18 ] and the turn-of-the-century era Europa Orbiter was canceled in 2002. [ 17 ] The flagship-level Europa Jupiter System Mission was in the works in the early 2000s, but funding issues resulted in it evolving into ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer . [ 19 ] Juno completed a five-year cruise to Jupiter, arriving on July 5, 2016. [ 7 ] The spacecraft traveled a total distance of roughly 2.8 × 10 ^ 9 km (19 AU; 1.7 × 10 ^ 9 mi) to reach Jupiter. [ 20 ] The spacecraft was designed to orbit Jupiter 37 times over the course of its mission. This was originally planned to take 20 months. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Juno 's trajectory used a gravity assist speed boost from Earth, accomplished by an Earth flyby in October 2013, two years after its launch on August 5, 2011. [ 21 ] The spacecraft performed an orbit insertion burn to slow it enough to allow capture. It was expected to make three 53-day orbits before performing another burn on December 11, 2016, that would bring it into a 14-day polar orbit called the Science Orbit. Because of a suspected problem in Juno 's main engine, the burn scheduled on December 11, 2016, was cancelled and Juno remained in its 53-day orbit until the first Ganymede encounter of its Extended Mission. [ 22 ] This extended mission began with a flyby of Ganymede on June 7, 2021. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Subsequent flybys of Europa and then Io will further decrease the orbital period to 33 days by February 2024. [ 25 ] During the science mission, infrared and microwave instruments will measure the thermal radiation emanating from deep within Jupiter's atmosphere . These observations will complement previous studies of its composition by assessing the abundance and distribution of water, and therefore oxygen. This data will provide insight into Jupiter's origins. Juno will also investigate the convection that drives natural circulation patterns in Jupiter's atmosphere. Other instruments aboard Juno will gather data about its gravitational field and polar magnetosphere . The Juno mission was planned to conclude in February 2018 after completing 37 orbits of Jupiter, but now has been commissioned through 2025 to do a further 42 additional orbits of Jupiter as well as close flybys of Ganymede, Europa and Io. [ 26 ] The probe was then intended to be deorbited and burnt up in Jupiter's outer atmosphere [ 4 ] [ 5 ] to avoid any possibility of impact and biological contamination of one of its moons. [ 27 ] Flight trajectory [ edit ] Juno awaiting its launch in 2011 Launch [ edit ] Juno was launched atop an Atlas V ( 551 configuration ) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), Florida on August 5, 2011, 16:25:00 UTC. The Atlas V (AV-029) used a Russian-built RD-180 main engine, powered by kerosene and liquid oxygen . The main engine ignited and underwent checkout then, 3.8 seconds later, the five strap-on solid rocket boosters (SRBs) ignited. Following the SRB burnout, about 93 seconds into the flight, two of the spent boosters fell away from the vehicle, followed 1.5 seconds later by the remaining three. When heating levels had dropped below predetermined limits, the payload fairing that protected Juno during launch and transit through the thickest part of the atmosphere separated, about 3 minutes 24 seconds into the flight. The Atlas V main engine cut off 4 minutes 26 seconds after liftoff. Sixteen seconds later, the Centaur second stage ignited, and it burned for about 6 minutes, putting the satellite into an initial parking orbit . [ 28 ] The vehicle coasted for about 30 minutes, and then the Centaur was reignited for a second firing of 9 minutes, placing the spacecraft on an Earth escape trajectory in a heliocentric orbit . [ 28 ] Prior to separation, the Centaur stage used onboard reaction engines to spin Juno up to 1.4 r.p.m. About 54 minutes after launch, the spacecraft separated from the Centaur and began to extend its solar panels . [ 28 ] Following the full deployment and locking of the solar panels, Juno 's batteries began to recharge. Deployment of the solar panels reduced Juno 's spin rate by two-thirds. The probe is spun to ensure stability during the voyage and so that all instruments on the probe are able to observe Jupiter. [ 27 ] [ 29 ] The voyage to Jupiter took five years, and included two orbital maneuvers in August and September 2012 and a flyby of the Earth on October 9, 2013. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] When it reached the Jovian system , Juno had traveled approximately 19 astronomical units (2.8 billion kilometres). [ 32 ] Atlas V on launch pad Lift-off Launch video Flyby of the Earth [ edit ] South America [ 33 ] as seen by JunoCam on its October 2013 Earth flyby Video of Earth and Moon taken by the Juno spacecraft After traveling for about a year in an elliptical heliocentric orbit, Juno fired its engine twice in 2012 near aphelion (beyond the orbit of Mars ) to change its orbit and return to pass by the Earth at a distance of 559 kilometers in October 2013. [ 30 ] It used Earth's gravity to help slingshot itself toward the Jovian system in a maneuver called a gravity assist . [ 34 ] The spacecraft received a boost in speed of more than 3.9 km/s (8,700 mph), and it was set on a course to Jupiter. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] The flyby was also used as a rehearsal for the Juno science team to test some instruments and practice certain procedures before the arrival at Jupiter. [ 34 ] [ 37 ] Insertion into Jovian orbit [ edit ] Jupiter's gravity accelerated the approaching spacecraft to around 210,000 km/h (130,000 mph). [ 38 ] On July 5, 2016, between 03:18 and 03:53 UTC Earth-received time , an insertion burn lasting 2,102 seconds decelerated Juno by 542 m/s (1,780 ft/s) [ 39 ] and changed its trajectory from a hyperbolic flyby to an elliptical , polar orbit with a period of about 53.5 days. [ 40 ] The spacecraft successfully entered Jovian orbit on July 5, 2016, at 03:53 UTC. [ 3 ] Orbit and environment [ edit ] Juno 's elliptical orbit and the Jovian radiation belts Juno 's highly elliptical initial polar orbit takes it within 4,200 km (2,600 mi) of the planet and out to 8.1 × 10 ^ 6 km (5.0 × 10 ^ 6 mi), far beyond Callisto 's orbit. An eccentricity -reducing burn, called the Period Reduction Maneuver, was planned that would drop the probe into a much shorter 14 day science orbit. [ 41 ] Originally, Juno was expected to complete 37 orbits over 20 months before the end of its mission. Due to problems with helium valves that are important during main engine burns, mission managers announced on February 17, 2017, that Juno would remain in its original 53-day orbit, since the chance of an engine misfire putting the spacecraft into a bad orbit was too high. [ 22 ] Juno completed only 12 science orbits before the end of its budgeted mission plan, ending July 2018. [ 42 ] In June 2018, NASA extended the mission through July 2021, as described below. The orbits were carefully planned in order to minimize contact with Jupiter's dense radiation belts , which can damage spacecraft electronics and solar panels, by exploiting a gap in the radiation envelope near the planet, passing through a region of minimal radiation. [ 8 ] [ 43 ] The \" Juno Radiation Vault \", with 1-centimeter-thick titanium walls (three times as thick as the Galileo spacecraft body's), also aids in protecting Juno 's electronics by reducing the incoming radiation by a factor of 800. [ 44 ] Despite the intense radiation, JunoCam and the Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) are expected to endure at least eight orbits, while the Microwave Radiometer (MWR) should endure at least eleven orbits. [ 45 ] Although the flux of electrons close to Jupiter is about ten times as high as it is around Jupiter's moon Europa, [ 46 ] Juno will still receive a lower total dose of radiation in its polar orbit (20 mrad through end of mission) [ 47 ] than the Galileo orbiter received in its equatorial orbit. Galileo 's subsystems were damaged by radiation during its mission, including an LED in its data recording system. [ 48 ] Orbital operations [ edit ] Animation of Juno 's trajectory around Jupiter from June 1, 2016, to October 25, 2025 Juno · Jupiter Ganymede , photographed on 7 June 2021 by Juno during its extended mission The spacecraft completed its first flyby of Jupiter ( perijove 1) on August 26, 2016, and captured the first images of the planet's north pole. [ 49 ] On October 14, 2016, days prior to perijove 2 and the planned Period Reduction Maneuver, telemetry showed that some of Juno 's helium valves were not opening properly. [ 50 ] On October 18, 2016, some 13 hours before its second close approach to Jupiter, Juno entered into safe mode , an operational mode engaged when its onboard computer encounters unexpected conditions. The spacecraft powered down all non-critical systems and reoriented itself to face the Sun to gather the most power. Due to this, no science operations were conducted during perijove 2. [ 51 ] On December 11, 2016, the spacecraft completed perijove 3, with all but one instrument operating and returning data. One instrument, JIRAM, was off pending a flight software update. [ 52 ] Perijove 4 occurred on February 2, 2017, with all instruments operating. [ 22 ] Perijove 5 occurred on March 27, 2017. [ 53 ] Perijove 6 took place on May 19, 2017. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] Although the mission's lifetime is inherently limited by radiation exposure, almost all of this dose was planned to be acquired during the perijoves. As of 2017 [update] , the 53.4 day orbit was planned to be maintained through July 2018 for a total of twelve science-gathering perijoves. At the end of this prime mission, the project was planned to go through a science review process by NASA's Planetary Science Division to determine if it will receive funding for an extended mission. [ 22 ] In June 2018, NASA extended the mission operations plan to July 2021. [ 55 ] In January 2021, NASA extended the mission operations to September 2025. [ 56 ] In this phase Juno began to examine Jupiter's inner moons, Ganymede , Europa and Io. A flyby of Ganymede occurred on June 7, 2021, 17:35 UTC , coming within 1,038 km (645 mi), the closest any spacecraft has come to the moon since Galileo in 2000. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 57 ] A flyby of Europa took place on September 29, 2022, at a distance of 352 km (219 mi). [ 58 ] [ 59 ] Juno performed two flybys of Io on December 30, 2023, and February 3, 2024, gathering observational data on volcanic activity. From April 2024, Juno will begin a series of experiments to learn more about Jupiter's interior shape and structure. [ 60 ] Planned deorbit and disintegration [ edit ] NASA originally planned to deorbit the spacecraft into the atmosphere of Jupiter after completing 32 orbits of Jupiter, but has since extended the mission to September 2025. [ 61 ] [ 56 ] The controlled deorbit is intended to eliminate space debris and risks of contamination in accordance with NASA's planetary protection guidelines. [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] Team [ edit ] Scott Bolton of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio , Texas is the principal investigator and is responsible for all aspects of the mission. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California manages the mission and the Lockheed Martin Corporation was responsible for the spacecraft development and construction. The mission is being carried out with the participation of several institutional partners. Coinvestigators include Toby Owen of the University of Hawaii , Andrew Ingersoll of California Institute of Technology , Frances Bagenal of the University of Colorado at Boulder , and Candy Hansen of the Planetary Science Institute . Jack Connerney of the Goddard Space Flight Center served as instrument lead. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] Cost [ edit ] Juno was originally proposed at a cost of approximately US$700 million (fiscal year 2003) for a launch in June 2009 (equivalent to US$1197 million in 2024). NASA budgetary restrictions resulted in postponement until August 2011, and a launch on board an Atlas V rocket in the 551 configuration . As of 2019 [update] the mission was projected to cost US$1.46 billion for operations and data analysis through 2022. [ 67 ] Scientific objectives [ edit ] Jupiter imaged using the VISIR instrument on the VLT . These observations will inform the work to be undertaken by Juno . [ 68 ] The Juno spacecraft's suite of science instruments will: [ 69 ] Determine the ratio of oxygen to hydrogen , effectively measuring the abundance of water in Jupiter, which will help distinguish among prevailing theories linking Jupiter's formation to the Solar System. Obtain a better estimate of Jupiter's core mass, which will also help distinguish among prevailing theories linking Jupiter's formation to the Solar System. Precisely map Jupiter's gravitational field to assess the distribution of mass in Jupiter's interior, including properties of its structure and dynamics. Precisely map Jupiter's magnetic field to assess the origin and structure of the field, and the depth at which the planet's magnetic field is created. This experiment will also help scientists understand the fundamental physics of dynamo theory . Map the variation in atmospheric composition, temperature, structure, cloud opacity and dynamics to pressures far greater than 100 bar (10 MPa; 1,500 psi) at all latitudes. Characterize and explore the three-dimensional structure of Jupiter's polar magnetosphere and auroras . [ 69 ] Measure the orbital frame-dragging , known also as Lense–Thirring precession caused by the angular momentum of Jupiter, [ 70 ] [ 71 ] and possibly a new test of general relativity effects connected with the Jovian rotation. [ 72 ] Scientific instruments [ edit ] The Juno mission's scientific objectives are being achieved with a payload of nine instruments on board the spacecraft: [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] Microwave radiometer (MWR) [ edit ] Main article: Microwave Radiometer (Juno) Microwave Radiometer The microwave radiometer comprises six antennas mounted on two of the sides of the body of the probe. They will perform measurements of electromagnetic waves on frequencies in the microwave range: 600 MHz , 1.2, 2.4, 4.8, 9.6 and 22 GHz, the only microwave frequencies which are able to pass through the thick Jovian atmosphere. The radiometer will measure the abundance of water and ammonia in the deep layers of the atmosphere up to 200 bar (20 MPa; 2,900 psi) pressure or 500–600 km (310–370 mi) deep. The combination of different wavelengths and the emission angle should make it possible to obtain a temperature profile at various levels of the atmosphere. The data collected will determine how deep the atmospheric circulation is. [ 78 ] [ 79 ] The MWR is designed to function through orbit 11 of Jupiter. [ 80 ] (Principal investigator: Mike Janssen, Jet Propulsion Laboratory ) Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) [ edit ] Main article: Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper The spectrometer mapper JIRAM, operating in the near infrared (between 2 and 5 μm), conducts surveys in the upper layers of the atmosphere to a depth of between 50 and 70 km (31 and 43 mi) where the pressure reaches 5 to 7 bar (500 to 700 kPa). JIRAM will provide images of the aurora in the wavelength of 3.4 μm in regions with abundant H 3 + ions. By measuring the heat radiated by the atmosphere of Jupiter, JIRAM can determine how clouds with water are flowing beneath the surface. It can also detect methane , water vapor , ammonia and phosphine . It was not required that this device meets the radiation resistance requirements. [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] The JIRAM instrument is expected to operate through the eighth orbit of Jupiter. [ 80 ] (Principal investigator: Alberto Adriani, Italian National Institute for Astrophysics ) JIRAM's  spin-compensation mirror is stuck since PJ44, but the instrument is operational. [ 84 ] Magnetometer (MAG) [ edit ] Main article: Magnetometer (Juno) MAG The magnetic field investigation has three goals: mapping of the magnetic field, determining the dynamics of Jupiter's interior, and determination of the three-dimensional structure of the polar magnetosphere. The magnetometer experiment consists of the Flux Gate Magnetometer ( FGM ), which will observe the strength and direction of the magnetic field lines, and the Advanced Stellar Compass ( ASC ), which will monitor the orientation of the magnetometer sensors. [ 75 ] (Principal investigator: Jack Connerney, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center ) Gravity Science (GS) [ edit ] Main article: Gravity Science (Juno) Gravity Science The purpose of measuring gravity by radio waves is to establish a map of the distribution of mass inside Jupiter. The uneven distribution of mass in Jupiter induces small variations in gravity all along the orbit followed by the probe when it runs closer to the surface of the planet. These gravity variations drive small probe velocity changes. The purpose of radio science is to detect the Doppler effect on radio broadcasts issued by Juno toward Earth in Ka-band and X-band , which are frequency ranges that can conduct the study with fewer disruptions related to the solar wind or Jupiter 's ionosphere . [ 85 ] [ 86 ] [ 74 ] (Principal investigator: John Anderson, Jet Propulsion Laboratory ; Principal investigator (Juno's Ka-band Translator): Luciano Iess, Sapienza University of Rome ) Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment (JADE) [ edit ] Main article: Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment JADE The energetic particle detector JADE will measure the angular distribution, energy, and the velocity vector of ions and electrons at low energy (ions between 13 eV and 20 KeV, electrons of 200 eV to 40 KeV) present in the aurora of Jupiter. On JADE, like JEDI, the electron analyzers are installed on three sides of the upper plate which allows a measure of frequency three times higher. [ 74 ] [ 87 ] (Principal investigator: David McComas , Southwest Research Institute ) Jovian Energetic Particle Detector Instrument (JEDI) [ edit ] Main article: Jovian Energetic Particle Detector Instrument JEDI The energetic particle detector JEDI will measure the angular distribution and the velocity vector of ions and electrons at high energy (ions between 20 keV and 1 MeV, electrons from 40 to 500 keV) present in the polar magnetosphere of Jupiter. JEDI has three identical sensors dedicated to the study of particular ions of hydrogen , helium , oxygen and sulfur . [ 74 ] [ 88 ] (Principal investigator: Barry Mauk, Applied Physics Laboratory ) Radio and Plasma Wave Sensor (Waves) [ edit ] Main article: Waves (Juno) Radio and Plasma Wave Sensor This instrument will identify the regions of auroral currents that define Jovian radio emissions and acceleration of the auroral particles by measuring the radio and plasma spectra in the auroral region. It will also observe the interactions between Jupiter's atmosphere and magnetosphere . The instrument consists of two antennae that detect radio and plasma waves. [ 75 ] (Principal investigator: William Kurth, University of Iowa ) Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS) [ edit ] Main article: UVS (Juno) Ultraviolet Spectrograph UVS will record the wavelength, position and arrival time of detected ultraviolet photons during the time when the spectrograph slit views Jupiter during each turn of the spacecraft. The instrument will provide spectral images of the UV auroral emissions in the polar magnetosphere. [ 75 ] (Principal investigator: G. Randall Gladstone, Southwest Research Institute ) JunoCam (JCM) [ edit ] Main article: JunoCam JunoCam A visible light camera/telescope, included in the payload to facilitate education and public outreach ; later re-purposed to study the dynamics of Jupiter's clouds, particularly those at the poles. [ 89 ] It was anticipated that it would operate through only eight orbits of Jupiter ending in September 2017 [ 90 ] due to the planet's damaging radiation and magnetic field, [ 80 ] but as of October 2023 (55 orbits), JunoCam remains operational. [ 91 ] (Principal investigator: Michael C. Malin , Malin Space Science Systems ) Locations of Juno 's science instruments Interactive 3D model of Juno Operational components [ edit ] Solar panels [ edit ] Illumination test on one of Juno 's solar panels Juno is the first mission to Jupiter to use solar panels instead of the radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG) used by Pioneer 10 , Pioneer 11 , the Voyager program , Ulysses , Cassini–Huygens , New Horizons , and the Galileo orbiter . [ 92 ] It is also the farthest solar-powered trip in the history of space exploration. [ 93 ] Once in orbit around Jupiter, Juno receives only 4% as much sunlight as it would on Earth , but the global shortage of plutonium-238 at the time, [ 94 ] [ 95 ] [ 96 ] [ 97 ] as well as advances made in solar cell technology over the past several decades, makes it economically preferable to use solar panels of practical size to provide power at a distance of 5 a.u. from the Sun . [ 98 ] The Juno spacecraft uses three solar panels symmetrically arranged around the spacecraft. Shortly after it cleared Earth's atmosphere, the panels were deployed. Two of the panels have four hinged segments each, and the third panel has three segments and a magnetometer . Each panel is 2.7 by 8.9 m (8 ft 10 in by 29 ft 2 in) [ 99 ] providing 50 square metres (540 sq ft) of active cells [ 100 ] [ 101 ] – the largest on any NASA deep-space probe at the time of launching. [ 102 ] The combined mass of the three panels is nearly 340 kg (750 lb). [ 103 ] If the panels were optimized to operate at Earth, they would produce 12 to 14 kilowatts of power. Only about 486 watts were generated when Juno arrived at Jupiter, projected to decline to near 420 watts as radiation degrades the cells. [ 104 ] The solar panels will remain in sunlight continuously from launch through the end of the mission, except for short periods during the operation of the main engine and eclipses by Jupiter. A central power distribution and drive unit monitors the power that is generated by the solar panels and distributes it to instruments, heaters, and experiment sensors, as well as to batteries that are charged when excess power is available. Two 55 Ah lithium-ion batteries that are able to withstand the radiation environment of Jupiter provide power when Juno passes through eclipse. [ 105 ] Telecommunications [ edit ] Juno 's high-gain antenna dish being installed Juno uses in-band signaling (\"tones\") for several critical operations as well as status reporting during cruise mode, [ 106 ] but it is expected to be used infrequently. Communications are via the 34 m (112 ft) and 70 m (230 ft) antennas of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) utilizing an X-band direct link. [ 105 ] The command and data processing of the Juno spacecraft includes a flight computer capable of providing about 50 Mbit/s of instrument throughput. Gravity science subsystems use the X-band and K a -band Doppler tracking and autoranging. [ 107 ] Due to telecommunications constraints, Juno will only be able to return about 40 megabytes of JunoCam data during each 11-day orbital period, limiting the number of images that are captured and transmitted during each orbit to somewhere between 10 and 100 depending on the compression level used. [ 108 ] [ needs update ] The overall amount of data downlinked on each orbit is significantly higher and used for the mission's scientific instruments; JunoCam is intended for public outreach and is thus secondary to the science data. This is comparable to the previous Galileo mission that orbited Jupiter, which captured thousands of images [ 109 ] despite its slow data rate of 1000 bit/s (at maximum compression level) due to the failure of its high gain antenna . The communication system is also used as part of the Gravity Science experiment. [ 110 ] Propulsion [ edit ] Juno uses a LEROS 1b main engine with hypergolic propellant , manufactured by Moog Inc in Westcott, Buckinghamshire , England. [ 111 ] It uses approx. 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) of hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide for propulsion, including 1,232 kg (2,716 lb) available for the Jupiter Orbit Insertion plus subsequent orbital maneuvers. The engine provides a thrust of 645 newtons . The engine bell is enclosed in a debris shield fixed to the spacecraft body, and is used for major burns. For control of the vehicle's orientation ( attitude control ) and to perform trajectory correction maneuvers, Juno utilizes a monopropellant reaction control system (RCS) consisting of twelve small thrusters that are mounted on four engine modules. [ 105 ] Galileo plaque and minifigures [ edit ] Galileo Galilei plaque Juno carries a plaque to Jupiter, dedicated to Galileo Galilei . The plaque was provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and measures 7.1 by 5.1 cm (2.8 by 2.0 in). It is made of flight-grade aluminum and weighs 6 g (0.21 oz). [ 112 ] The plaque depicts a portrait of Galileo and a text in Galileo's own handwriting, penned in January 1610, while observing what would later be known to be the Galilean moons . [ 112 ] The text translates as: On the 11th it was in this formation – and the star closest to Jupiter was half the size than the other and very close to the other so that during the previous nights all of the three observed stars looked of the same dimension and among them equally afar; so that it is evident that around Jupiter there are three moving stars invisible till this time to everyone. The spacecraft also carries three Lego minifigures representing Galileo Galilei, the Roman god Jupiter , and his sister and wife, the goddess Juno . In Roman mythology, Jupiter drew a veil of clouds around himself to hide his mischief. Juno was able to peer through the clouds and reveal Jupiter's true nature. The Juno minifigure holds a magnifying glass as a sign of searching for the truth, and Jupiter holds a lightning bolt. The third Lego crew member, Galileo Galilei, has his telescope with him on the journey. [ 113 ] The figurines were produced in partnership between NASA and Lego as part of an outreach program to inspire children's interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). [ 114 ] Although most Lego toys are made of plastic, Lego specially made these minifigures of aluminum to endure the extreme conditions of space flight. [ 115 ] Scientific results [ edit ] Among early results, Juno gathered information about Jovian lightning that revised earlier theories. [ 116 ] Juno provided the first views of Jupiter's north pole, as well as providing insight about Jupiter's aurorae, magnetic field, and atmosphere. [ 117 ] In 2021, analysis of the frequency of interplanetary dust impacts (primarily on the backs of the solar panels), as Juno passed between Earth and the asteroid belt, indicated that this dust, which causes the Zodiacal light , comes from Mars , rather than from comets or asteroids that come from the outer solar system, as was previously thought. [ 118 ] Juno made many discoveries that are challenging existing theories about Jupiter's formation. When Juno flew over the poles of Jupiter it imaged clusters of stable cyclones that exist at the poles. [ 119 ] It found that the magnetosphere of Jupiter is uneven and chaotic. Using its Microwave Radiometer, Juno found that the red and white bands that can be seen on Jupiter extend hundreds of kilometers into the Jovian atmosphere, yet the interior of Jupiter is not evenly mixed. This has resulted in the theory that Jupiter does not have a solid core as previously thought, but a \"fuzzy\" core made of pieces of rock and metallic hydrogen . This peculiar core may be a result of a collision that happened early on in Jupiter's formation. [ 120 ] In April 2020, Juno detected a meteor impact on Jupiter , with estimated mass of 250-5000 kg. [ 121 ] Results from Juno on storms suggests that they are far taller than expected, with some extending 60 miles (100 kilometers) below the cloud tops and others, including the Great Red Spot, extending over 200 miles (350 kilometers). With Juno traveling low over Jupiter's cloud deck at about 130,000 mph (209,000 kph) Juno scientists were able to measure velocity changes as small 0.01 millimeter per second using a NASA's Deep Space Network tracking antenna, from a distance of more than 400 million miles (650 million kilometers). This enabled the team to constrain the depth of the Great Red Spot to about 300 miles (500 kilometers) below the cloud tops. The new results show that the cyclones are warmer on top, with lower atmospheric densities, while they are colder at the bottom, with higher densities. Anticyclones, which rotate in the opposite direction, are colder at the top but warmer at the bottom. [ 122 ] Timeline [ edit ] Date ( UTC ) Event Latitude (centric) [ 123 ] Longitude (Sys.

The Voyager program is an American scientific program that employs two interstellar probes , Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 . They were launched in 1977 to take advantage of a favorable planetary alignment to explore the two gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and potentially also the ice giants, Uranus and Neptune - to fly near them while collecting data for transmission back to Earth. After Voyager 1 successfully completed its flyby of Saturn and its moon Titan , it was decided to send Voyager 2 on flybys of Uranus and Neptune . [ 1 ] After the planetary flybys were complete, decisions were made to keep the probes in operation to explore interstellar space and the outer regions of the solar system. On 25 August 2012, data from Voyager 1 indicated that it had entered interstellar space. [ 2 ] On 5 November 2019, data from Voyager 2 indicated that it also had entered interstellar space. [ 3 ] On 4 November 2019, scientists reported that on 5 November 2018, the Voyager 2 probe had officially reached the interstellar medium (ISM), a region of outer space beyond the influence of the solar wind , as did Voyager 1 in 2012. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] In August 2018, NASA confirmed, based on results by the New Horizons spacecraft, the existence of a \" hydrogen wall \" at the outer edges of the Solar System that was first detected in 1992 by the two Voyager spacecraft. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] As of 2024, [update] the Voyagers are still in operation beyond the outer boundary of the heliosphere in interstellar space . Voyager 1 is moving with a velocity of 61,198 kilometers per hour (38,027 mph), or 17 km/s, (10.5 miles/second) relative to the Sun, and is 24,475,900,000 kilometers (1.52086 × 10 10 mi) from the Sun [ 10 ] reaching a distance of 162 AU (24.2 billion km ; 15.1 billion mi ) from Earth as of May 25, 2024. [ 11 ] As of 2024 [update] , Voyager 2 is moving with a velocity of 55,347 kilometers per hour (34,391 mph), or 15 km/s, relative to the Sun, and is 20,439,100,000 kilometers (1.27003 × 10 10 mi) from the Sun [ 12 ] reaching a distance of 136.627 AU (20.4 billion km ; 12.7 billion mi ) from Earth as of May 25, 2024. [ 11 ] The two Voyagers are the only human-made objects to date that have passed into interstellar space — a record they will hold until at least the 2040s — and Voyager 1 is the farthest human-made object from Earth. [ 13 ] History [ edit ] Further information: Grand Tour program Mariner Jupiter-Saturn [ edit ] See also: Grand Tour program § Mariner Jupiter-Saturn The trajectories that enabled the Voyager spacecraft to visit the outer planets and achieve velocity to escape the Solar System Plot of Voyager 2 ' s heliocentric velocity against its distance from the Sun, illustrating the use of gravity assist to accelerate the spacecraft by Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. To observe Triton , Voyager 2 passed over Neptune's north pole, resulting in an acceleration out of the plane of the ecliptic and reduced its velocity away from the Sun. [ 14 ] Voyager did things no one predicted, found scenes no one expected, and promises to outlive its inventors. Like a great painting or an abiding institution, it has acquired an existence of its own, a destiny beyond the grasp of its handlers. — Stephen J. Pyne [ 1 ] The two Voyager space probes were originally conceived as part of the Planetary Grand Tour planned during the late 1960s and early 70s that aimed to explore Jupiter , Saturn , Saturn's moon , Titan , Uranus , Neptune , and Pluto . The mission originated from the Grand Tour program , conceptualized by Gary Flandro , an aerospace engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in 1964, which leveraged a rare planetary alignment occurring once every 175 years. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] This alignment allowed a craft to reach all outer planets using gravitational assists . The mission was to send several pairs of probes and gained momentum in 1966 when it was endorsed by NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory . However, in December 1971, the Grand Tour mission was canceled when funding was redirected to the Space Shuttle program . [ 17 ] In 1972, a scaled-down (four planets, two identical spacecraft) mission was proposed, utilizing a spacecraft derived from the Mariner series, initially intended to be Mariner 11 and Mariner 12 . The gravity-assist technique, successfully demonstrated by Mariner 10 , would be used to achieve significant velocity changes by maneuvering through an intermediate planet's gravitational field to minimize time towards Saturn. [ 18 ] The spacecrafts were then moved into a separate program named Mariner Jupiter-Saturn (also Mariner Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus , [ 19 ] MJS , or MJSU ), part of the Mariner program , later renamed because it was thought that the design of the two space probes had progressed sufficiently beyond that of the Mariner family to merit a separate name. [ 20 ] Voyager probes [ edit ] Interactive 3D model of the Voyager spacecraft . On March 4, 1977, NASA announced a competition to rename the mission, believing the existing name was not appropriate as the mission had differed significantly from previous Mariner missions. Voyager was chosen as the new name, referencing an earlier suggestion by William Pickering , who had proposed the name Navigator . Due to the name change occurring close to launch, the probes were still occasionally referred to as Mariner 11 and Mariner 12, or even Voyager 11 and Voyager 12. [ 17 ] Two mission trajectories were established: JST aimed at Jupiter, Saturn, and enhancing a Titan flyby, while JSX served as a contingency plan. JST focused on a Titan flyby, while JSX provided a flexible mission plan. If JST succeeded, JSX could proceed with the Grand Tour, but in case of failure, JSX could be redirected for a separate Titan flyby, forfeiting the Grand Tour opportunity. [ 18 ] The second probe, now Voyager 2 , followed the JSX trajectory, granting it the option to continue on to Uranus and Neptune. Upon Voyager 1 completing its main objectives at Saturn, Voyager 2 received a mission extension, enabling it to proceed to Uranus and Neptune. This allowed Voyager 2 to diverge from the originally planned JST trajectory. [ 17 ] The probes would be launched in August or September 1977, with their main objective being to compare the characteristics of Jupiter and Saturn, such as their atmospheres , magnetic fields , particle environments, ring systems , and moons . They would fly by planets and moons in either a JST or JSX trajectory. After completing their flybys, the probes would communicate with Earth, relaying vital data using their magnetometers , spectrometers , and other instruments to detect interstellar , solar , and cosmic radiation . Their radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) would limit the maximum communication time with the probes to roughly a decade . Following their primary missions, the probes would continue to drift into interstellar space. [ 18 ] Voyager 2 was the first to be launched. Its trajectory was designed to allow flybys of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Voyager 1 was launched after Voyager 2 , but along a shorter and faster trajectory that was designed to provide an optimal flyby of Saturn's moon Titan , [ 21 ] which was known to be quite large and to possess a dense atmosphere. This encounter sent Voyager 1 out of the plane of the ecliptic, ending its planetary science mission. [ 22 ] Had Voyager 1 been unable to perform the Titan flyby, the trajectory of Voyager 2 could have been altered to explore Titan, forgoing any visit to Uranus and Neptune. [ 23 ] Voyager 1 was not launched on a trajectory that would have allowed it to continue to Uranus and Neptune, but could have continued from Saturn to Pluto without exploring Titan. [ 24 ] During the 1990s, Voyager 1 overtook the slower deep-space probes Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 to become the most distant human-made object from Earth, a record that it will keep for the foreseeable future. The New Horizons probe, which had a higher launch velocity than Voyager 1 , is travelling more slowly due to the extra speed Voyager 1 gained from its flybys of Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 1 and Pioneer 10 are the most widely separated human-made objects anywhere since they are travelling in roughly opposite directions from the Solar System . In December 2004, Voyager 1 crossed the termination shock , where the solar wind is slowed to subsonic speed, and entered the heliosheath , where the solar wind is compressed and made turbulent due to interactions with the interstellar medium . On 10 December 2007, Voyager 2 also reached the termination shock, about 1.6 billion kilometres (1 billion miles) closer to the Sun than from where Voyager 1 first crossed it, indicating that the Solar System is asymmetrical . [ 25 ] In 2010 Voyager 1 reported that the outward velocity of the solar wind had dropped to zero, and scientists predicted it was nearing interstellar space . [ 26 ] In 2011, data from the Voyagers determined that the heliosheath is not smooth, but filled with giant magnetic bubbles, theorized to form when the magnetic field of the Sun becomes warped at the edge of the Solar System. [ 27 ] In June 2012, Scientists at NASA reported that Voyager 1 was very close to entering interstellar space, indicated by a sharp rise in high-energy particles from outside the Solar System. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] In September 2013, NASA announced that Voyager 1 had crossed the heliopause on 25 August 2012, making it the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In December 2018, NASA announced that Voyager 2 had crossed the heliopause on 5 November 2018, making it the second spacecraft to enter interstellar space. [ 3 ] As of 2017 [update] Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 continue to monitor conditions in the outer expanses of the Solar System. [ 33 ] The Voyager spacecraft are expected to be able to operate science instruments through 2020, when limited power will require instruments to be deactivated one by one. Sometime around 2025, there will no longer be sufficient power to operate any science instruments. In July 2019, a revised power management plan was implemented to better manage the two probes' dwindling power supply. [ 34 ] Spacecraft design [ edit ] Voyager spacecraft diagram The Voyager spacecraft each weighed 815 kilograms (1,797 pounds) at launch, but after fuel usage are now about 733 kilograms (1,616 pounds). [ 35 ] Of this weight, each spacecraft carries 105 kilograms (231 pounds) of scientific instruments. [ 36 ] The identical Voyager spacecraft use three-axis-stabilized guidance systems that use gyroscopic and accelerometer inputs to their attitude control computers to point their high-gain antennas towards the Earth and their scientific instruments towards their targets, sometimes with the help of a movable instrument platform for the smaller instruments and the electronic photography system. The diagram shows the high-gain antenna (HGA) with a 3.7 m (12 ft) diameter dish attached to the hollow decagonal electronics container. There is also a spherical tank that contains the hydrazine monopropellant fuel. The Voyager Golden Record is attached to one of the bus sides. The angled square panel to the right is the optical calibration target and excess heat radiator. The three radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) are mounted end-to-end on the lower boom. The scan platform comprises: the Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) (largest camera at top right); the Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS) just above the IRIS; the two Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) vidicon cameras to the left of the UVS; and the Photopolarimeter System (PPS) under the ISS. Only five investigation teams are still supported, though data is collected for two additional instruments. [ 37 ] The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) and a single eight-track digital tape recorder (DTR) provide the data handling functions. The FDS configures each instrument and controls instrument operations. It also collects engineering and science data and formats the data for transmission . The DTR is used to record high-rate Plasma Wave Subsystem (PWS) data, which is played back every six months. The Imaging Science Subsystem made up of a wide-angle and a narrow-angle camera is a modified version of the slow scan vidicon camera designs that were used in the earlier Mariner flights. The Imaging Science Subsystem consists of two television-type cameras, each with eight filters in a commandable filter wheel mounted in front of the vidicons. One has a low resolution 200 mm (7.9 in) focal length wide-angle lens with an aperture of f/3 (the wide-angle camera), while the other uses a higher resolution 1,500 mm (59 in) narrow-angle f/8.5 lens (the narrow-angle camera). Three spacecraft were built, Voyager 1 (VGR 77-1), Voyager 2 (VGR 77-3), and test spare model (VGR 77-2).

On the boom, center and right, are plasma, particle, and cosmic ray detectors. Voyager's fully extended 13-meter-long magnetometer boom Computers and data processing [ edit ] There are three different computer types on the Voyager spacecraft, two of each kind, sometimes used for redundancy. They are proprietary, custom-built computers built from CMOS and TTL medium-scale CMOS integrated circuits and discrete components, mostly from the 7400 series of Texas Instruments . [ 41 ] Total number of words among the six computers is about 32K. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have identical computer systems. [ 35 ] [ 42 ] The Computer Command System (CCS), the central controller of the spacecraft, has two 18-bit word, interrupt-type processors with 4096 words each of non-volatile plated-wire memory . During most of the Voyager mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used non-redundantly to increase the command and processing capability of the spacecraft. The CCS is nearly identical to the system flown on the Viking spacecraft. [ 43 ] The Flight Data System (FDS) is two 16-bit word machines with modular memories and 8198 words each. The Attitude and Articulation Control System (AACS) is two 18-bit word machines with 4096 words each. Unlike the other on-board instruments, the operation of the cameras for visible light is not autonomous, but rather it is controlled by an imaging parameter table contained in one of the on-board digital computers , the Flight Data Subsystem (FDS). More recent space probes, since about 1990, usually have completely autonomous cameras. The computer command subsystem (CCS) controls the cameras. The CCS contains fixed computer programs such as command decoding, fault detection, and correction routines, antenna-pointing routines, and spacecraft sequencing routines. This computer is an improved version of the one that was used in the Viking orbiter . [ 43 ] The hardware in both custom-built CCS subsystems in the Voyagers is identical. There is only a minor software modification for one of them that has a scientific subsystem that the other lacks. According to Guinness Book of Records, CCS holds record of \"longest period of continual operation for a computer\". It has been running continuously since 20 August 1977. [ 44 ] The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) controls the spacecraft orientation (its attitude). It keeps the high-gain antenna pointing towards the Earth, controls attitude changes, and points the scan platform. The custom-built AACS systems on both craft are identical. It has been erroneously reported [ 45 ] on the Internet that the Voyager space probes were controlled by a version of the RCA 1802 (RCA CDP1802 \"COSMAC\" microprocessor ), but such claims are not supported by the primary design documents. The CDP1802 microprocessor was used later in the Galileo space probe , which was designed and built years later. The digital control electronics of the Voyagers were not based on a microprocessor integrated-circuit chip. Communications [ edit ] The uplink communications are executed via S-band microwave communications . The downlink communications are carried out by an X-band microwave transmitter on board the spacecraft, with an S-band transmitter as a back-up. All long-range communications to and from the two Voyagers have been carried out using their 3.7-meter (12 ft) high-gain antennas. The high-gain antenna has a beamwidth of 0.5° for X-band, and 2.3° for S-band. [ 46 ] : 17 (The low-gain antenna has a 7 dB gain and 60° beamwidth.) [ 46 ] : 17 Because of the inverse-square law in radio communications , the digital data rates used in the downlinks from the Voyagers have been continually decreasing the farther that they get from the Earth. For example, the data rate used from Jupiter was about 115,000 bits per second. That was halved at the distance of Saturn, and it has gone down continually since then. [ 46 ] Some measures were taken on the ground along the way to reduce the effects of the inverse-square law. In between 1982 and 1985, the diameters of the three main parabolic dish antennas of the Deep Space Network were increased from 64 to 70 m (210 to 230 ft) [ 46 ] : 34 dramatically increasing their areas for gathering weak microwave signals. Whilst the craft were between Saturn and Uranus the onboard software was upgraded to do a degree of image compression and to use a more efficient Reed-Solomon error-correcting encoding . [ 46 ] : 33 Then between 1986 and 1989, new techniques were brought into play to combine the signals from multiple antennas on the ground into one, more powerful signal, in a kind of an antenna array . [ 46 ] : 34 This was done at Goldstone, California , Canberra (Australia) , and Madrid (Spain) using the additional dish antennas available there. Also, in Australia, the Parkes Radio Telescope was brought into the array in time for the fly-by of Neptune in 1989. In the United States, the Very Large Array in New Mexico was brought into temporary use along with the antennas of the Deep Space Network at Goldstone. [ 46 ] : 34 Using this new technology of antenna arrays helped to compensate for the immense radio distance from Neptune to the Earth. Power [ edit ] RTGs for the Voyager program Electrical power is supplied by three MHW-RTG radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). They are powered by plutonium-238 (distinct from the Pu-239 isotope used in nuclear weapons) and provided approximately 470 W at 30 volts DC when the spacecraft was launched. Plutonium-238 decays with a half-life of 87.74 years, [ 47 ] so RTGs using Pu-238 will lose a factor of 1−0.5 (1/87.74) = 0.79% of their power output per year. In 2011, 34 years after launch, the thermal power generated by such an RTG would be reduced to (1/2) (34/87.74) ≈ 76% of its initial power. The RTG thermocouples , which convert thermal power into electricity, also degrade over time reducing available electric power below this calculated level. By 7 October 2011 the power generated by Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 had dropped to 267.9 W and 269.2 W respectively, about 57% of the power at launch. The level of power output was better than pre-launch predictions based on a conservative thermocouple degradation model. As the electrical power decreases, spacecraft loads must be turned off, eliminating some capabilities. There may be insufficient power for communications by 2032. [ 48 ] Voyager Interstellar Mission [ edit ] Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause, or the edge of the heliosphere , in August 2012. Voyager 2 crossed the heliosheath in November 2018. [ 3 ] [ 49 ] The Voyager primary mission was completed in 1989, with the close flyby of Neptune by Voyager 2 . The Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) is a mission extension, which began when the two spacecraft had already been in flight for over 12 years. [ 50 ] The Heliophysics Division of the NASA Science Mission Directorate conducted a Heliophysics Senior Review in 2008. The panel found that the VIM \"is a mission that is absolutely imperative to continue\" and that VIM \"funding near the optimal level and increased DSN ( Deep Space Network ) support is warranted.\" [ 51 ] The main objective of the VIM was to extend the exploration of the Solar System beyond the outer planets to the heliopause (the farthest extent at which the Sun's radiation predominates over interstellar winds) and if possible even beyond. Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause boundary in 2012, followed by Voyager 2 in 2018. Passing through the heliopause boundary has allowed both spacecraft to make measurements of the interstellar fields, particles and waves unaffected by the solar wind . Two significant findings so far have been the discovery of a region of magnetic bubbles [ 52 ] and no indication of an expected shift in the Solar magnetic field. [ 53 ] The entire Voyager 2 scan platform, including all of the platform instruments, was switched off in 1998. All platform instruments on Voyager 1 , except for the ultraviolet spectrometer (UVS) [ 54 ] have also been switched off. The Voyager 1 scan platform was scheduled to go off-line in late 2000 but has been left on to investigate UV emission from the upwind direction.\n",
            "UVS data are still captured but scans are no longer possible. [ 55 ] Gyro operations ended in 2016 for Voyager 2 and in 2017 for Voyager 1 . Gyro operations are used to rotate the probe 360 degrees six times per year to measure the magnetic field of the spacecraft, which is then subtracted from the magnetometer science data. The two spacecraft continue to operate, with some loss in subsystem redundancy but retain the capability to return scientific data from a full complement of Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) science instruments. Both spacecraft also have adequate electrical power and attitude control propellant to continue operating until around 2025, after which there may not be electrical power to support science instrument operation; science data return and spacecraft operations will cease. [ 56 ] Mission details [ edit ] This diagram about the heliosphere was released on 28 June 2013 and incorporates results from the Voyager spacecraft. [ 57 ] By the start of VIM, Voyager 1 was at a distance of 40 AU from the Earth, while Voyager 2 was at 31 AU. VIM is in three phases: termination shock, heliosheath exploration, and interstellar exploration phase. The spacecraft began VIM in an environment controlled by the Sun's magnetic field, with the plasma particles being dominated by those contained in the expanding supersonic solar wind. This is the characteristic environment of the termination shock phase. At some distance from the Sun, the supersonic solar wind will be held back from further expansion by the interstellar wind. The first feature encountered by a spacecraft as a result of this interaction – between interstellar wind and solar wind – was the termination shock, where the solar wind slows to subsonic speed, and large changes in plasma flow direction and magnetic field orientation occur. Voyager 1 completed the phase of termination shock in December 2004 at a distance of 94 AU, while Voyager 2 completed it in August 2007 at a distance of 84 AU. After entering into the heliosheath, the spacecraft were in an area that is dominated by the Sun's magnetic field and solar wind particles. After passing through the heliosheath, the two Voyagers began the phase of interstellar exploration. The outer boundary of the heliosheath is called the heliopause. This is the region where the Sun's influence begins to decrease and interstellar space can be detected. [ 58 ] Voyager 1 is escaping the Solar System at the speed of 3.6 AU per year 35° north of the ecliptic in the general direction of the solar apex in Hercules , while Voyager 2 ' s speed is about 3.3 AU per year, heading 48° south of the ecliptic. The Voyager spacecraft will eventually go on to the stars. In about 40,000 years , Voyager 1 will be within 1.6 light years (ly) of AC+79 3888, also known as Gliese 445 , which is approaching the Sun. In 40,000 years Voyager 2 will be within 1.7 ly of Ross 248 (another star which is approaching the Sun), and in 296,000 years it will pass within 4.6 ly of Sirius , which is the brightest star in the night-sky. [ 2 ] The spacecraft are not expected to collide with a star for 1 sextillion (10 20 ) years. [ 59 ] In October 2020, astronomers reported a significant unexpected increase in density in the space beyond the Solar System , as detected by the Voyager space probes . According to the researchers, this implies that \"the density gradient is a large-scale feature of the VLISM (very local interstellar medium ) in the general direction of the heliospheric nose \". [ 60 ] [ 61 ] Voyager Golden Record [ edit ] Main article: Voyager Golden Record The cover of the golden record Both spacecraft carry a 12-inch (30 cm) golden phonograph record that contains pictures and sounds of Earth, symbolic directions on the cover for playing the record, and data detailing the location of Earth. [ 33 ] [ 29 ] The record is intended as a combination time capsule and an interstellar message to any civilization, alien or far-future human, that may recover either of the Voyagers. The contents of this record were selected by a committee that included Timothy Ferris and was chaired by Carl Sagan . [ 29 ] Pale Blue Dot [ edit ] Main article: Pale Blue Dot Seen from 6 billion kilometers (3.7 billion miles), Earth appears as a \" pale blue dot \" (the blueish-white speck approximately halfway down the light band to the right). Pale Blue Dot is a photograph of Earth taken on February 14, 1990, by the Voyager 1 space probe from a distance of approximately 6 billion kilometers ( 3.7 billion miles, 40.5 AU ), as part of that day's Family Portrait series of images of the Solar System . [ 62 ] The Voyager program's discoveries during the primary phase of its mission, including new close-up color photos of the major planets, were regularly documented by print and electronic media outlets. Among the best-known of these is an image of the Earth as a Pale Blue Dot , taken in 1990 by Voyager 1 , and popularized by Carl Sagan, [ 63 ] Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us....The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.... To my mind, there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Named after astronomer Johannes Kepler , [ 8 ] the spacecraft was launched into an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit . The principal investigator was William J. Borucki . After nine and a half years of operation, the telescope's reaction control system fuel was depleted, and NASA announced its retirement on October 30, 2018. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Designed to survey a portion of Earth's region of the Milky Way to discover Earth-size exoplanets in or near habitable zones and to estimate how many of the billions of stars in the Milky Way have such planets, [ 6 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Kepler's sole scientific instrument is a photometer that continually monitored the brightness of approximately 150,000 main sequence stars in a fixed field of view. [ 13 ] These data were transmitted to Earth, then analyzed to detect periodic dimming caused by exoplanets that cross in front of their host star. Only planets whose orbits are seen edge-on from Earth could be detected. Kepler observed 530,506 stars, and had detected 2,778 confirmed planets as of June 16, 2023. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] History [ edit ] Pre-launch development [ edit ] The Kepler space telescope was part of NASA's Discovery Program of relatively low-cost science missions. The telescope's construction and initial operation were managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , with Ball Aerospace responsible for developing the Kepler flight system. [ 16 ] In January 2006, the project's launch was delayed eight months because of budget cuts and consolidation at NASA. [ 17 ] It was delayed again by four months in March 2006 due to fiscal problems. [ 17 ] During this time, the high-gain antenna was changed from a design using a gimbal to one fixed to the frame of the spacecraft to reduce cost and complexity, at the cost of one observation day per month. [ 18 ] Post launch [ edit ] The Ames Research Center was responsible for the ground system development, mission operations since December 2009, and scientific data analysis. The initial planned lifetime was three and a half years, [ 19 ] but greater-than-expected noise in the data , from both the stars and the spacecraft, meant additional time was needed to fulfill all mission goals. Initially, in 2012, the mission was expected to be extended until 2016, [ 20 ] but on July 14, 2012, one of the four reaction wheels used for pointing the spacecraft stopped turning, and completing the mission would only be possible if the other three all remained reliable. [ 21 ] Then, on May 11, 2013, a second one failed, disabling the collection of science data [ 22 ] and threatening the continuation of the mission. [ 23 ] On August 15, 2013, NASA announced that they had given up trying to fix the two failed reaction wheels. This meant the current mission needed to be modified, but it did not necessarily mean the end of planet hunting. NASA had asked the space science community to propose alternative mission plans \"potentially including an exoplanet search, using the remaining two good reaction wheels and thrusters\". [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] On November 18, 2013, the K2 \"Second Light\" proposal was reported. This would include utilizing the disabled Kepler in a way that could detect habitable planets around smaller, dimmer red dwarfs . [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] On May 16, 2014, NASA announced the approval of the K2 extension. [ 32 ] By January 2015, Kepler and its follow-up observations had found 1,013 confirmed exoplanets in about 440 star systems , along with a further 3,199 unconfirmed planet candidates. [ B ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Four planets have been confirmed through Kepler's K2 mission. [ 35 ] In November 2013, astronomers estimated, based on Kepler space mission data, that there could be as many as 40 billion rocky Earth-size exoplanets orbiting in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars and red dwarfs within the Milky Way . [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] It is estimated that 11 billion of these planets may be orbiting Sun-like stars. [ 39 ] The nearest such planet may be 3.7 parsecs (12 ly ) away, according to the scientists. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] On January 6, 2015, NASA announced the 1,000th confirmed exoplanet discovered by the Kepler space telescope. Four of the newly confirmed exoplanets were found to orbit within habitable zones of their related stars : three of the four, Kepler-438b , Kepler-442b and Kepler-452b , are almost Earth-size and likely rocky; the fourth, Kepler-440b , is a super-Earth . [ 40 ] On May 10, 2016, NASA verified 1,284 new exoplanets found by Kepler, the single largest finding of planets to date. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Kepler data have also helped scientists observe and understand supernovae ; measurements were collected every half-hour so the light curves were especially useful for studying these types of astronomical events. [ 44 ] On October 30, 2018, after the spacecraft ran out of fuel, NASA announced that the telescope would be retired. [ 45 ] The telescope was shut down the same day, bringing an end to its nine-year service. Kepler observed 530,506 stars and discovered 2,662 exoplanets over its lifetime. [ 15 ] A newer NASA mission, TESS , launched in 2018, is continuing the search for exoplanets. [ 46 ] Spacecraft design [ edit ] Kepler in Astrotech's Hazardous Processing Facility Interactive 3D model of Kepler The telescope has a mass of 1,039 kilograms (2,291 lb) and contains a Schmidt camera with a 0.95-meter (37.4 in) front corrector plate (lens) feeding a 1.4-meter (55 in) primary mirror —at the time of its launch this was the largest mirror on any telescope outside Earth orbit, [ 47 ] though the Herschel Space Observatory took this title a few months later. Its telescope has a 115 deg 2 (about 12-degree diameter) field of view (FoV), roughly equivalent to the size of one's fist held at arm's length. Of this, 105 deg 2 is of science quality, with less than 11% vignetting . The photometer has a soft focus to provide excellent photometry , rather than sharp images. The mission goal was a combined differential photometric precision (CDPP) of 20 ppm for a m (V)=12 Sun-like star for a 6.5-hour integration, though the observations fell short of this objective (see mission status ). Camera [ edit ] Kepler's image sensor array. The array is curved to account for Petzval field curvature . The focal plane of the spacecraft's camera is made out of forty-two 50 × 25 mm (2 × 1 in) CCDs at 2200×1024 pixels each, possessing a total resolution of 94.6 megapixels , [ 48 ] [ 49 ] which at the time made it the largest camera system launched into space. [ 19 ] The array was cooled by heat pipes connected to an external radiator. [ 1 ] The CCDs were read out every 6.5 seconds (to limit saturation) and co-added on board for 58.89 seconds for short cadence targets, and 1765.5 seconds (29.4 minutes) for long cadence targets. [ 50 ] Due to the larger bandwidth requirements for the former, these were limited in number to 512 compared to 170,000 for long cadence. However, even though at launch Kepler had the highest data rate of any NASA mission, [ citation needed ] the 29-minute sums of all 95 million pixels constituted more data than could be stored and sent back to Earth. Therefore, the science team pre-selected the relevant pixels associated with each star of interest, amounting to about 6 percent of the pixels (5.4 megapixels). The data from these pixels was then requantized, compressed and stored, along with other auxiliary data, in the on-board 16 gigabyte solid-state recorder. Data that was stored and downlinked includes science stars, p-mode stars , smear, black level, background and full field-of-view images. [ 1 ] [ 51 ] Primary mirror [ edit ] Comparison of primary mirror sizes for the Kepler telescope and other notable optical telescopes. The Kepler primary mirror is 1.4 meters (4.6 ft) in diameter. Manufactured by glass maker Corning using ultra-low expansion (ULE) glass , the mirror is specifically designed to have a mass only 14% that of a solid mirror of the same size. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] To produce a space telescope system with sufficient sensitivity to detect relatively small planets, as they pass in front of stars, a very high reflectance coating on the primary mirror was required. Using ion assisted evaporation , Surface Optics Corp. applied a protective nine-layer silver coating to enhance reflection and a dielectric interference coating to minimize the formation of color centers and atmospheric moisture absorption. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] Photometric performance [ edit ] In terms of photometric performance, Kepler worked well, much better than any Earth-bound telescope, but short of design goals. The objective was a combined differential photometric precision (CDPP) of 20 parts per million (PPM) on a magnitude 12 star for a 6.5-hour integration. This estimate was developed allowing 10 ppm for stellar variability, roughly the value for the Sun. The obtained accuracy for this observation has a wide range, depending on the star and position on the focal plane, with a median of 29 ppm. Most of the additional noise appears to be due to a larger-than-expected variability in the stars themselves (19.5 ppm as opposed to the assumed 10.0 ppm), with the rest due to instrumental noise sources slightly larger than predicted. [ 56 ] [ 48 ] Because decrease in brightness from an Earth-size planet transiting a Sun-like star is so small, only 80 ppm, the increased noise means each individual transit is only a 2.7 σ event, instead of the intended 4 σ. This, in turn, means more transits must be observed to be sure of a detection. Scientific estimates indicated that a mission lasting 7 to 8 years, as opposed to the originally planned 3.5 years, would be needed to find all transiting Earth-sized planets. [ 57 ] On April 4, 2012, the Kepler mission was approved for extension through the fiscal year 2016, [ 20 ] [ 58 ] but this also depended on all remaining reaction wheels staying healthy, which turned out not to be the case (see Reaction wheel issues below). Orbit and orientation [ edit ] Kepler's search volume, in the context of the Milky Way The motion of Kepler relative to Earth, slowly drifting away from Earth in a similar orbit, looking like a spiral over time Kepler orbits the Sun , [ 59 ] [ 60 ] which avoids Earth occultations , stray light, and gravitational perturbations and torques inherent in an Earth orbit. NASA has characterized Kepler's orbit as \"Earth-trailing\". [ 61 ] With an orbital period of 372.5 days, Kepler is slowly falling farther behind Earth (about 16 million miles per annum ). As of May 1, 2018 [update] , the distance to Kepler from Earth was about 0.917 AU (137 million km). [ 3 ] This means that after about 26 years Kepler will reach the other side of the Sun and will get back to the neighborhood of the Earth after 51 years. Until 2013 the photometer pointed to a field in the northern constellations of Cygnus , Lyra and Draco , which is well out of the ecliptic plane, so that sunlight never enters the photometer as the spacecraft orbits. [ 1 ] This is also the direction of the Solar System's motion around the center of the galaxy. Thus, the stars which Kepler observed are roughly the same distance from the Galactic Center as the Solar System , and also close to the galactic plane . This fact is important if position in the galaxy is related to habitability, as suggested by the Rare Earth hypothesis . Orientation is three-axis stabilized by sensing rotations using fine-guidance sensors located on the instrument focal plane (instead of rate sensing gyroscopes, e.g. as used on Hubble ). [ 1 ] and using reaction wheels and hydrazine thrusters [ 62 ] to control the orientation. Animation of Kepler 's trajectory Relative to the Sun Relative to Earth Relative to Sun and Earth Kepler · Earth · Sun Operations [ edit ] Kepler's orbit. The telescope's solar array was adjusted at solstices and equinoxes . Kepler was operated out of Boulder, Colorado , by the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) under contract to Ball Aerospace & Technologies . The spacecraft's solar array was rotated to face the Sun at the solstices and equinoxes , so as to optimize the amount of sunlight falling on the solar array and to keep the heat radiator pointing towards deep space. [ 1 ] Together, LASP and Ball Aerospace controlled the spacecraft from a mission operations center located on the research campus of the University of Colorado . LASP performs essential mission planning and the initial collection and distribution of the science data. The mission's initial life-cycle cost was estimated at US$600 million, including funding for 3.5 years of operation. [ 1 ] In 2012, NASA announced that the Kepler mission would be funded until 2016 at a cost of about $20 million per year. [ 20 ] Communications [ edit ] NASA contacted the spacecraft using the X band communication link twice a week for command and status updates. Scientific data are downloaded once a month using the K a band link at a maximum data transfer rate of approximately 550 kB/s . The high gain antenna is not steerable so data collection is interrupted for a day to reorient the whole spacecraft and the high gain antenna for communications to  Earth. [ 1 ] : 16 The Kepler space telescope conducted its own partial analysis on board and only transmitted scientific data deemed necessary to the mission in order to conserve bandwidth. [ 63 ] Data management [ edit ] Science data telemetry collected during mission operations at LASP is sent for processing to the Kepler Data Management Center (DMC) which is located at the Space Telescope Science Institute on the campus of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland . The science data telemetry is decoded and processed into uncalibrated FITS -format science data products by the DMC, which are then passed along to the Science Operations Center (SOC) at NASA Ames Research Center, for calibration and final processing. The SOC at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) develops and operates the tools needed to process scientific data for use by the Kepler Science Office (SO). Accordingly, the SOC develops the pipeline data processing software based on scientific algorithms developed jointly by the SO and SOC. During operations, the SOC: [ 64 ] Receives uncalibrated pixel data from the DMC Applies the analysis algorithms to produce calibrated pixels and light curves for each star Performs transit searches for detection of planets (threshold-crossing events, or TCEs) Performs data validation of candidate planets by evaluating various data products for consistency as a way to eliminate false positive detections The SOC also evaluates the photometric performance on an ongoing basis and provides the performance metrics to the SO and Mission Management Office. Finally, the SOC develops and maintains the project's scientific databases, including catalogs and processed data. The SOC finally returns calibrated data products and scientific results back to the DMC for long-term archiving, and distribution to astronomers around the world through the Multimission Archive at STScI (MAST). Reaction wheel failures [ edit ] On July 14, 2012, one of the four reaction wheels used for fine pointing of the spacecraft failed. [ 65 ] While Kepler requires only three reaction wheels to accurately aim the telescope, another failure would leave the spacecraft unable to aim at its original field. [ 66 ] After showing some problems in January 2013, a second reaction wheel failed on May 11, 2013, ending Kepler's primary mission. The spacecraft was put into safe mode, then from June to August 2013 a series of engineering tests were done to try to recover either failed wheel. By August 15, 2013, it was decided that the wheels were unrecoverable, [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] and an engineering report was ordered to assess the spacecraft's remaining capabilities. [ 24 ] This effort ultimately led to the \"K2\" follow-on mission observing different fields near the ecliptic. Operational timeline [ edit ] Kepler's launch on March 7, 2009 Interior illustration of Kepler A 2004 illustration of Kepler In January 2006, the project's launch was delayed eight months because of budget cuts and consolidation at NASA. [ 17 ] It was delayed again by four months in March 2006 due to fiscal problems. [ 17 ] At this time, the high-gain antenna was changed from a gimballed design to one fixed to the frame of the spacecraft to reduce cost and complexity, at the cost of one observation day per month. The Kepler observatory was launched on March 7, 2009, at 03:49:57 UTC aboard a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , Florida. [ 2 ] [ 5 ] The launch was a success and all three stages were completed by 04:55 UTC. The cover of the telescope was jettisoned on April 7, 2009, and the first light images were taken on the next day. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] On April 20, 2009, it was announced that the Kepler science team had concluded that further refinement of the focus would dramatically increase the scientific return. [ 69 ] On April 23, 2009, it was announced that the focus had been successfully optimized by moving the primary mirror 40 micrometers (1.6 thousandths of an inch) towards the focal plane and tilting the primary mirror 0.0072 degree. [ 70 ] On May 13, 2009, at 00:01 UTC, Kepler successfully completed its commissioning phase and began its search for planets around other stars. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] On June 19, 2009, the spacecraft successfully sent its first science data to Earth. It was discovered that Kepler had entered safe mode on June 15. A second safe mode event occurred on July 2. In both cases the event was triggered by a processor reset . The spacecraft resumed normal operation on July 3 and the science data that had been collected since June 19 was downlinked that day. [ 73 ] On October 14, 2009, the cause of these safing events was determined to be a low voltage power supply that provides power to the RAD750 processor. [ 74 ] On January 12, 2010, one portion of the focal plane transmitted anomalous data, suggesting a problem with focal plane MOD-3 module, covering two out of Kepler's 42 CCDs . As of October 2010 [update] , the module was described as \"failed\", but the coverage still exceeded the science goals. [ 75 ] Kepler downlinked roughly twelve gigabytes of data [ 76 ] about once per month. [ 77 ] Field of view [ edit ] Diagram of Kepler's investigated area with celestial coordinates Kepler has a fixed field of view (FOV) against the sky. The diagram to the right shows the celestial coordinates and where the detector fields are located, along with the locations of a few bright stars with celestial north at the top left corner. The mission website has a calculator [ 78 ] that will determine if a given object falls in the FOV, and if so, where it will appear in the photo detector output data stream. Data on exoplanet candidates is submitted to the Kepler Follow-up Program , or KFOP, to conduct follow-up observations. The photometer's field of view in the constellations Cygnus , Lyra and Draco Kepler's field of view covers 115 square degrees , around 0.25 percent of the sky, or \"about two scoops of the Big Dipper\". Thus, it would require around 400 Kepler-like telescopes to cover the whole sky. [ 79 ] The Kepler field contains portions of the constellations Cygnus , Lyra , and Draco . The nearest star system in Kepler's field of view is the triple star system Gliese 1245 , 15 light years from the Sun. The brown dwarf WISE J2000+3629, 22.8 ± 1 light years from the Sun is also in the field of view, but is invisible to Kepler due to emitting light primarily in infrared wavelengths. Objectives and methods [ edit ] The scientific objective of the Kepler space telescope was to explore the structure and diversity of planetary systems . [ 80 ] This spacecraft observes a large sample of stars to achieve several key goals: To determine how many Earth-size and larger planets there are in or near the habitable zone (often called \"Goldilocks planets\") [ 81 ] of a wide variety of spectral types of stars. To determine the range of size and shape of the orbits of these planets. To estimate how many planets there are in multiple-star systems. To determine the range of orbit size, brightness, size, mass and density of short-period giant planets. To identify additional members of each discovered planetary system using other techniques. Determine the properties of those stars that harbor planetary systems. Most of the exoplanets previously detected by other projects were giant planets , mostly the size of Jupiter and bigger. Kepler was designed to look for planets 30 to 600 times less massive, closer to the order of Earth's mass (Jupiter is 318 times more massive than Earth). The method used, the transit method , involves observing repeated transit of planets in front of their stars, which causes a slight reduction in the star's apparent magnitude , on the order of 0.01% for an Earth-size planet. The degree of this reduction in brightness can be used to deduce the diameter of the planet, and the interval between transits can be used to deduce the planet's orbital period, from which estimates of its orbital semi-major axis (using Kepler's laws ) and its temperature (using models of stellar radiation) can be calculated. [ citation needed ] The probability of a random planetary orbit being along the line-of-sight to a star is the diameter of the star divided by the diameter of the orbit. [ 82 ] For an Earth-size planet at 1 AU transiting a Sun-like star the probability is 0.47%, or about 1 in 210. [ 82 ] For a planet like Venus orbiting a Sun-like star the probability is slightly higher, at 0.65%; [ 82 ] If the host star has multiple planets, the probability of additional detections is higher than the probability of initial detection assuming planets in a given system tend to orbit in similar planes—an assumption consistent with current models of planetary system formation. [ 82 ] For instance, if a Kepler -like mission conducted by aliens observed Earth transiting the Sun, there is a 7% chance that it would also see Venus transiting. [ 82 ] Kepler's 115 deg 2 field of view gives it a much higher probability of detecting Earth-sized planets than the Hubble Space Telescope , which has a field of view of only 10 sq. arc-minutes . Moreover, Kepler is dedicated to detecting planetary transits, while the Hubble Space Telescope is used to address a wide range of scientific questions, and rarely looks continuously at just one starfield. Of the approximately half-million stars in Kepler's field of view, around 150,000 stars were selected for observation. More than 90,000 are G-type stars on, or near, the main sequence . Thus, Kepler was designed to be sensitive to wavelengths of 400–865 nm where brightness of those stars peaks. Most of the stars observed by Kepler have apparent visual magnitude between 14 and 16 but the brightest observed stars have apparent visual magnitude of 8 or lower. Most of the planet candidates were initially not expected to be confirmed due to being too faint for follow-up observations. [ 83 ] All the selected stars are observed simultaneously, with the spacecraft measuring variations in their brightness every thirty minutes. This provides a better chance for seeing a transit. The mission was designed to maximize the probability of detecting planets orbiting other stars. [ 1 ] [ 84 ] Because Kepler must observe at least three transits to confirm that the dimming of a star was caused by a transiting planet, and because larger planets give a signal that is easier to check, scientists expected the first reported results to be larger Jupiter-size planets in tight orbits. The first of these were reported after only a few months of operation. Smaller planets, and planets farther from their sun would take longer, and discovering planets comparable to Earth were expected to take three years or longer. [ 59 ] Data collected by Kepler is also being used for studying variable stars of various types and performing asteroseismology , [ 85 ] particularly on stars showing solar-like oscillations . [ 86 ] Planet finding process [ edit ] Finding planet candidates [ edit ] Artist's impression of Kepler Once Kepler has collected and sent back the data, raw light curves are constructed. Brightness values are then adjusted to take the brightness variations due to the rotation of the spacecraft into account. The next step is processing (folding) light curves into a more easily observable form and letting software select signals that seem potentially transit-like. At this point, any signal that shows potential transit-like features is called a threshold crossing event. These signals are individually inspected in two inspection rounds, with the first round taking only a few seconds per target. This inspection eliminates erroneously selected non-signals, signals caused by instrumental noise and obvious eclipsing binaries. [ 87 ] Threshold crossing events that pass these tests are called Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI), receive a KOI designation and are archived. KOIs are inspected more thoroughly in a process called dispositioning. Those which pass the dispositioning are called Kepler planet candidates. The KOI archive is not static, meaning that a Kepler candidate could end up in the false-positive list upon further inspection. In turn, KOIs that were mistakenly classified as false positives could end up back in the candidates list. [ 88 ] Not all the planet candidates go through this process. Circumbinary planets do not show strictly periodic transits, and have to be inspected through other methods. In addition, third-party researchers use different data-processing methods, or even search planet candidates from the unprocessed light curve data. As a consequence, those planets may be missing KOI designation. Confirming planet candidates [ edit ] Kepler mission – new exoplanet candidates – as of June 19, 2017. [ 89 ] Once suitable candidates have been found from Kepler data, it is necessary to rule out false positives with follow-up tests. Usually, Kepler candidates are imaged individually with more-advanced ground-based telescopes in order to resolve any background objects which could contaminate the brightness signature of the transit signal. [ 90 ] Another method to rule out planet candidates is astrometry for which Kepler can collect good data even though doing so was not a design goal. While Kepler cannot detect planetary-mass objects with this method, it can be used to determine if the transit was caused by a stellar-mass object. [ 91 ] Through other detection methods [ edit ] There are a few different exoplanet detection methods which help to rule out false positives by giving further proof that a candidate is a real planet. One of the methods, called doppler spectroscopy , requires follow-up observations from ground-based telescopes. This method works well if the planet is massive or is located around a relatively bright star. While current spectrographs are insufficient for confirming planetary candidates with small masses around relatively dim stars, this method can be used to discover additional massive non-transiting planet candidates around targeted stars. [ citation needed ] A photo taken by Kepler with two points of interest outlined. Celestial north is towards the lower left corner. In multiplanetary systems, planets can often be confirmed through transit timing variation by looking at the time between successive transits, which may vary if planets are gravitationally perturbed by each other. This helps to confirm relatively low-mass planets even when the star is relatively distant. Transit timing variations indicate that two or more planets belong to the same planetary system. There are even cases where a non-transiting planet is also discovered in this way. [ 92 ] Circumbinary planets show much larger transit timing variations between transits than planets gravitationally disturbed by other planets. Their transit duration times also vary significantly. Transit timing and duration variations for circumbinary planets are caused by the orbital motion of the host stars, rather than by other planets. [ 93 ] In addition, if the planet is massive enough, it can cause slight variations of the host stars' orbital periods. Despite being harder to find circumbinary planets due to their non-periodic transits, it is much easier to confirm them, as timing patterns of transits cannot be mimicked by an eclipsing binary or a background star system. [ 94 ] In addition to transits, planets orbiting around their stars undergo reflected-light variations—like the Moon , they go through phases from full to new and back again. Because Kepler cannot resolve the planet from the star, it sees only the combined light, and the brightness of the host star seems to change over each orbit in a periodic manner. Although the effect is small—the photometric precision required to see a close-in giant planet is about the same as to detect an Earth-sized planet in transit across a solar-type star—Jupiter-sized planets with an orbital period of a few days or less are detectable by sensitive space telescopes such as Kepler. In the long run, this method may help find more planets than the transit method, because the reflected light variation with orbital phase is largely independent of the planet's orbital inclination, and does not require the planet to pass in front of the disk of the star. In addition, the phase function of a giant planet is also a function of its thermal properties and atmosphere, if any. Therefore, the phase curve may constrain other planetary properties, such as the particle size distribution of the atmospheric particles. [ 95 ] Kepler's photometric precision is often high enough to observe a star's brightness changes caused by doppler beaming or a star's shape deformation by a companion. These can sometimes be used to rule out hot Jupiter candidates as false positives caused by a star or a brown dwarf when these effects are too noticeable. [ 96 ] However, there are some cases where such effects are detected even by planetary-mass companions such as TrES-2b . [ 97 ] Through validation [ edit ] If a planet cannot be detected through at least one of the other detection methods, it can be confirmed by determining if the possibility of a Kepler candidate being a real planet is significantly larger than any false-positive scenarios combined. One of the first methods was to see if other telescopes can see the transit as well. The first planet confirmed through this method was Kepler-22b which was also observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope in addition to analyzing any other false-positive possibilities. [ 98 ] Such confirmation is costly, as small planets can generally be detected only with space telescopes. In 2014, a new confirmation method called \"validation by multiplicity\" was announced. From the planets previously confirmed through various methods, it was found that planets in most planetary systems orbit in a relatively flat plane, similar to the planets found in the Solar System. This means that if a star has multiple planet candidates, it is very likely a real planetary system. [ 99 ] Transit signals still need to meet several criteria which rule out false-positive scenarios. For instance, it has to have considerable signal-to-noise ratio, it has at least three observed transits, orbital stability of those systems have to be stable and transit curve has to have a shape that partly eclipsing binaries could not mimic the transit signal. In addition, its orbital period needs to be 1.6 days or longer to rule out common false positives caused by eclipsing binaries. [ 100 ] Validation by multiplicity method is very efficient and allows to confirm hundreds of Kepler candidates in a relatively short amount of time. A new validation method using a tool called PASTIS has been developed. It makes it possible to confirm a planet even when only a single candidate transit event for the host star has been detected. A drawback of this tool is that it requires a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio from Kepler data, so it can mainly confirm only larger planets or planets around quiet and relatively bright stars. Currently, the analysis of Kepler candidates through this method is underway. [ 101 ] PASTIS was first successful for validating the planet Kepler-420b. [ 102 ] K2 Extension [ edit ] Predicted structure of the Milky Way overlaid with the original Kepler search space. [ 6 ] In April 2012, an independent panel of senior NASA scientists recommended that the Kepler mission be continued through 2016. According to the senior review, Kepler observations needed to continue until at least 2015 to achieve all the stated scientific goals. [ 103 ] On November 14, 2012, NASA announced the completion of Kepler's primary mission, and the beginning of its extended mission, which ended in 2018 when it ran out of fuel. [ 104 ] Reaction wheel issues [ edit ] In July 2012, one of Kepler's four reaction wheels (wheel 2) failed. [ 24 ] On May 11, 2013, a second wheel (wheel 4) failed, jeopardizing the continuation of the mission, as three wheels are necessary for its planet hunting. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Kepler had not collected science data since May because it was not able to point with sufficient accuracy. [ 105 ] On July 18 and 22 reaction wheels 4 and 2 were tested respectively; wheel 4 only rotated counter-clockwise but wheel 2 ran in both directions, albeit with significantly elevated friction levels. [ 106 ] A further test of wheel 4 on July 25 managed to achieve bi-directional rotation. [ 107 ] Both wheels, however, exhibited too much friction to be useful. [ 26 ] On August 2, NASA put out a call for proposals to use the remaining capabilities of Kepler for other scientific missions. Starting on August 8, a full systems evaluation was conducted. It was determined that wheel 2 could not provide sufficient precision for scientific missions and the spacecraft was returned to a \"rest\" state to conserve fuel. [ 24 ] Wheel 4 was previously ruled out because it exhibited higher friction levels than wheel 2 in previous tests. [ 107 ] Sending astronauts to fix Kepler is not an option because it orbits the Sun and is millions of kilometers from Earth. [ 26 ] On August 15, 2013, NASA announced that Kepler would not continue searching for planets using the transit method after attempts to resolve issues with two of the four reaction wheels failed. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] An engineering report was ordered to assess the spacecraft's capabilities, its two good reaction wheels and its thrusters. [ 24 ] Concurrently, a scientific study was conducted to determine whether enough knowledge can be obtained from Kepler's limited scope to justify its $18 million per year cost. Possible ideas included searching for asteroids and comets, looking for evidence of supernovas, and finding huge exoplanets through gravitational microlensing . [ 26 ] Another proposal was to modify the software on Kepler to compensate for the disabled reaction wheels. Instead of the stars being fixed and stable in Kepler's field of view, they will drift. Proposed software was to track this drift and more or less completely recover the mission goals despite being unable to hold the stars in a fixed view. [ 108 ] Previously collected data continued to be analyzed. [ 109 ] Second Light (K2) [ edit ] In November 2013, a new mission plan named K2 \"Second Light\" was presented for consideration. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 110 ] K2 would involve using Kepler's remaining capability, photometric precision of about 300 parts per million, compared with about 20 parts per million earlier, to collect data for the study of \" supernova explosions , star formation and Solar-System bodies such as asteroids and comets , ... \" and for finding and studying more exoplanets . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 110 ] In this proposed mission plan, Kepler would search a much larger area in the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 110 ] Celestial objects, including exoplanets, stars and others, detected by the K2 mission would be associated with the EPIC acronym , standing for Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog . K2 mission timeline (August 8, 2014). [ 111 ] In early 2014, the spacecraft underwent successful testing for the K2 mission. [ 112 ] From March to May 2014, data from a new field called Field 0 was collected as a testing run. [ 113 ] On May 16, 2014, NASA announced the approval of extending the Kepler mission to the K2 mission. [ 32 ] Kepler's photometric precision for the K2 mission was estimated to be 50 ppm on a magnitude 12 star for a 6.5-hour integration. [ 114 ] In February 2014, photometric precision for the K2 mission using two-wheel, fine-point precision operations was measured as 44 ppm on magnitude 12 stars for a 6.5-hour integration. The analysis of these measurements by NASA suggests the K2 photometric precision approaches that of the Kepler archive of three-wheel, fine-point precision data. [ 115 ] On May 29, 2014, campaign fields 0 to 13 were reported and described in detail. [ 116 ] K2 proposal explained (December 11, 2013). [ 30 ] Field 1 of the K2 mission is set towards the Leo - Virgo region of the sky, while Field 2 is towards the \"head\" area of Scorpius and includes two globular clusters, Messier 4 and Messier 80 , [ 117 ] and part of the Scorpius–Centaurus association , which is only about 11 million years old [ 118 ] and 120–140 parsecs (380–470 ly ) distant [ 119 ] with probably over 1,000 members. [ 120 ] On December 18, 2014, NASA announced that the K2 mission had detected its first confirmed exoplanet, a super-Earth named HIP 116454 b . Its signature was found in a set of engineering data meant to prepare the spacecraft for the full K2 mission. Radial velocity follow-up observations were needed as only a single transit of the planet was detected. [ 121 ] During a scheduled contact on April 7, 2016, Kepler was found to be operating in emergency mode, the lowest operational and most fuel intensive mode. Mission operations declared a spacecraft emergency, which afforded them priority access to NASA's Deep Space Network . [ 122 ] [ 123 ] By the evening of April 8 the spacecraft had been upgraded to safe mode, and on April 10 it was placed into point-rest state, [ 124 ] a stable mode which provides normal communication and the lowest fuel burn. [ 122 ] At that time, the cause of the emergency was unknown, but it was not believed that Kepler's reaction wheels or a planned maneuver to support K2 's Campaign 9 were responsible. Operators downloaded and analyzed engineering data from the spacecraft, with the prioritization of returning to normal science operations. [ 122 ] [ 125 ] Kepler was returned to science mode on April 22. [ 126 ] The emergency caused the first half of Campaign 9 to be shortened by two weeks. [ 127 ] In June 2016, NASA announced a K2 mission extension of three additional years, beyond the expected exhaustion of on-board fuel in 2018. [ 128 ] In August 2018, NASA roused the spacecraft from sleep mode, applied a modified configuration to deal with thruster problems that degraded pointing performance, and began collecting scientific data for the 19th observation campaign, finding that the onboard fuel was not yet utterly exhausted. [ 129 ] On October 30, 2018, NASA announced that the spacecraft was out of fuel and its mission was officially ended. [ 130 ] Mission results [ edit ] Detail of Kepler 's image of the investigated area showing open star cluster NGC 6791 . Celestial north is towards the lower left corner. Detail of Kepler 's image of the investigated area. The location of TrES-2b within this image is shown. Celestial north is towards the lower left corner. The Kepler space telescope was in active operation from 2009 through 2013, with the first main results announced on January 4, 2010. As expected, the initial discoveries were all short-period planets. As the mission continued, additional longer-period candidates were found. As of November 2018 [update] , Kepler has discovered 5,011 exoplanet candidates and 2,662 confirmed exoplanets. [ 131 ] [ 132 ] As of August 2022, 2,056 exoplanet candidates remain to be confirmed and 2,711 are now confirmed exoplanets. [ 133 ] 2009 [ edit ] NASA held a press conference to discuss early science results of the Kepler mission on August 6, 2009. [ 134 ] At this press conference, it was revealed that Kepler had confirmed the existence of the previously known transiting exoplanet HAT-P-7b , and was functioning well enough to discover Earth-size planets. [ 135 ] [ 136 ] Because Kepler's detection of planets depends on seeing very small changes in brightness, stars that vary in brightness by themselves ( variable stars ) are not useful in this search. [ 77 ] From the first few months of data, Kepler scientists determined that about 7,500 stars from the initial target list are such variable stars. These were dropped from the target list, and replaced by new candidates. On November 4, 2009, the Kepler project publicly released the light curves of the dropped stars. [ 137 ] The first new planet candidate observed by Kepler was originally marked as a false positive because of uncertainties in the mass of its parent star. However, it was confirmed ten years later and is now designated Kepler-1658b . [ 138 ] [ 139 ] The first six weeks of data revealed five previously unknown planets, all very close to their stars. [ 140 ] [ 141 ] Among the notable results are one of the least dense planets yet found, [ 142 ] two low-mass white dwarfs [ 143 ] that were initially reported as being members of a new class of stellar objects, [ 144 ] and Kepler-16b , a well-characterized planet orbiting a binary star. 2010 [ edit ] On June 15, 2010, the Kepler mission released data on all but 400 of the ~156,000 planetary target stars to the public. 706 targets from this first data set have viable exoplanet candidates, with sizes ranging from as small as Earth to larger than Jupiter. The identity and characteristics of 306 of the 706 targets were given. The released targets included five [ citation needed ] candidate multi-planet systems, including six extra exoplanet candidates. [ 145 ] Only 33.5 days of data were available for most of the candidates. [ 145 ] NASA also announced data for another 400 candidates were being withheld to allow members of the Kepler team to perform follow-up observations. [ 146 ] The data for these candidates was published February 2, 2011. [ 147 ] (See the Kepler results for 2011 below.) The Kepler results, based on the candidates in the list released in 2010, implied that most candidate planets have radii less than half that of Jupiter. The  results also imply that small candidate planets with periods less than thirty days are much more common than large candidate planets with periods less than thirty days and that the ground-based discoveries are sampling the large-size tail of the size distribution. [ 145 ] This contradicted older theories which had suggested small and Earth-size planets would be relatively infrequent. [ 148 ] [ 149 ] Based on extrapolations from the Kepler data, an estimate of around 100 million habitable planets in the Milky Way may be realistic. [ 150 ] Some media reports of the TED talk have led to the misunderstanding that Kepler had actually found these planets. This was clarified in a letter to the Director of the NASA Ames Research Center , for the Kepler Science Council dated August 2, 2010 states, \"Analysis of the current Kepler data does not support the assertion that Kepler has found any Earth-like planets.\" [ 7 ] [ 151 ] [ 152 ] In 2010, Kepler identified two systems containing objects which are smaller and hotter than their parent stars: KOI 74 and KOI 81 . [ 153 ] These objects are probably low-mass white dwarfs produced by previous episodes of mass transfer in their systems. [ 143 ] 2011 [ edit ] A size comparison of the exoplanets Kepler-20e [ 154 ] and Kepler-20f [ 155 ] with Venus and Earth On February 2, 2011, the Kepler team announced the results of analysis of the data taken between 2 May and September 16, 2009. [ 147 ] They found 1235 planetary candidates circling 997 host stars. (The numbers that follow assume the candidates are really planets, though the official papers called them only candidates. Independent analysis indicated that at least 90% of them are real planets and not false positives). [ 156 ] 68 planets were approximately Earth-size, 288 super-Earth -size, 662 Neptune-size, 165 Jupiter-size, and 19 up to twice the size of Jupiter. In contrast to previous work, roughly 74% of the planets are smaller than Neptune, most likely as a result of previous work finding large planets more easily than smaller ones. That February 2, 2011 release of 1235 exoplanet candidates included 54 that may be in the \" habitable zone \", including five less than twice the size of Earth. [ 157 ] [ 158 ] There were previously only two planets thought to be in the \"habitable zone\", so these new findings represent an enormous expansion of the potential number of \"Goldilocks planets\" (planets of the right temperature to support liquid water). [ 159 ] All of the habitable zone candidates found thus far orbit stars significantly smaller and cooler than the Sun (habitable candidates around Sun-like stars will take several additional years to accumulate the three transits required for detection). [ 160 ] Of all the new planet candidates, 68 are 125% of Earth 's size or smaller, or smaller than all previously discovered exoplanets. [ 158 ] \"Earth-size\" and \"super-Earth-size\" is defined as \"less than or equal to 2 Earth radii (Re)\" [(or, Rp ≤ 2.0 Re) – Table 5]. [ 147 ] Six such planet candidates [namely: KOI 326.01 (Rp=0.85), KOI 701.03 (Rp=1.73), KOI 268.01 (Rp=1.75), KOI 1026.01 (Rp=1.77), KOI 854.01 (Rp=1.91), KOI 70.03 (Rp=1.96) – Table 6] [ 147 ] are in the \"habitable zone.\" [ 157 ] A more recent study found that one of these candidates (KOI 326.01) is in fact much larger and hotter than first reported. [ 161 ] The frequency of planet observations was highest for exoplanets two to three times Earth-size, and then declined in inverse proportionality to the area of the planet. The best estimate (as of March 2011), after accounting for observational biases, was: 5.4% of stars host Earth-size candidates, 6.8% host super-Earth-size candidates, 19.3% host Neptune-size candidates, and 2.55% host Jupiter-size or larger candidates. Multi-planet systems are common; 17% of the host stars have multi-candidate systems, and 33.9% of all the planets are in multiple planet systems. [ 162 ] By December 5, 2011, the Kepler team announced that they had discovered 2,326 planetary candidates, of which 207 are similar in size to Earth, 680 are super-Earth-size, 1,181 are Neptune-size, 203 are Jupiter-size and 55 are larger than Jupiter. Compared to the February 2011 figures, the number of Earth-size and super-Earth-size planets increased by 200% and 140% respectively. Moreover, 48 planet candidates were found in the habitable zones of surveyed stars, marking a decrease from the February figure; this was due to the more stringent criteria in use in the December data. [ 163 ] On December 20, 2011, the Kepler team announced the discovery of the first Earth-size exoplanets , Kepler-20e [ 154 ] and Kepler-20f , [ 155 ] orbiting a Sun-like star , Kepler-20 . [ 164 ] Based on Kepler's findings, astronomer Seth Shostak estimated in 2011 that \"within a thousand light-years of Earth\", there are \"at least 30,000\" habitable planets. [ 165 ] Also based on the findings, the Kepler team has estimated that there are \"at least 50 billion planets in the Milky Way\", of which \"at least 500 million\" are in the habitable zone . [ 166 ] In March 2011, astronomers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) reported that about \"1.4 to 2.7 percent\" of all Sun-like stars are expected to have Earth-size planets \"within the habitable zones of their stars\". This means there are \"two billion\" of these \"Earth analogs\" in the Milky Way alone. The JPL astronomers also noted that there are \"50 billion other galaxies\", potentially yielding more than one sextillion \"Earth analog\" planets if all galaxies have similar numbers of planets to the Milky Way. [ 167 ] 2012 [ edit ] In January 2012, an international team of astronomers reported that each star in the Milky Way may host \" on average...at least 1.6 planets \", suggesting that over 160 billion star-bound planets may exist in the Milky Way. [ 168 ] [ 169 ] Kepler also recorded distant stellar super-flares , some of which are 10,000 times more powerful than the 1859 Carrington event . [ 170 ] The superflares may be triggered by close-orbiting Jupiter -sized planets. [ 170 ] The Transit Timing Variation (TTV) technique, which was used to discover Kepler-9d , gained popularity for confirming exoplanet discoveries. [ 171 ] A planet in a system with four stars was also confirmed, the first time such a system had been discovered. [ 172 ] As of 2012 [update] , there were a total of 2,321 candidates . [ 163 ] [ 173 ] [ 174 ] Of these, 207 are similar in size to Earth, 680 are super-Earth-size, 1,181 are Neptune-size, 203 are Jupiter-size and 55 are larger than Jupiter. Moreover, 48 planet candidates were found in the habitable zones of surveyed stars. The Kepler team estimated that 5.4% of all stars host Earth-size planet candidates, and that 17% of all stars have multiple planets. 2013 [ edit ] A chart showing Kepler discoveries, in context of all discovered exoplanets (through 2013), with some transit probabilities indicated for example scenarios. According to a study by Caltech astronomers published in January 2013, the Milky Way contains at least as many planets as it does stars, resulting in 100–400 billion exoplanets . [ 175 ] [ 176 ] The study, based on planets orbiting the star Kepler-32 , suggests that planetary systems may be common around stars in the Milky Way. The discovery of 461 more candidates was announced on January 7, 2013. [ 105 ] The longer Kepler watches, the more planets with long periods it can detect. [ 105 ] Since the last Kepler catalog was released in February 2012, the number of candidates discovered in the Kepler data has increased by 20 percent and now totals 2,740 potential planets orbiting 2,036 stars A candidate, newly announced on January 7, 2013, was Kepler-69c (formerly, KOI-172.02 ), an Earth-size exoplanet orbiting a star similar to the Sun in the habitable zone and possibly habitable. [ 177 ] In April 2013, a white dwarf was discovered bending the light of its companion red dwarf in the KOI-256 star system. [ 178 ] In April 2013, NASA announced the discovery of three new Earth-size exoplanets— Kepler-62e , Kepler-62f , and Kepler-69c —in the habitable zones of their respective host stars, Kepler-62 and Kepler-69 . The new exoplanets are considered prime candidates for possessing liquid water and thus a habitable environment. [ 179 ] [ 180 ] [ 181 ] A more recent analysis has shown that Kepler-69c is likely more analogous to Venus, and thus unlikely to be habitable. [ 182 ] On May 15, 2013, NASA announced the space telescope had been crippled by failure of a reaction wheel that keeps it pointed in the right direction. A second wheel had previously failed, and the telescope required three wheels (out of four total) to be operational for the instrument to function properly. Further testing in July and August determined that while Kepler was capable of using its damaged reaction wheels to prevent itself from entering safe mode and of downlinking previously collected science data it was not capable of collecting further science data as previously configured. [ 183 ] Scientists working on the Kepler project said there was a backlog of data still to be looked at, and that more discoveries would be made in the following couple of years, despite the setback. [ 184 ] Although no new science data from Kepler field had been collected since the problem, an additional sixty-three candidates were announced in July 2013 based on the previously collected observations. [ 185 ] In November 2013, the second Kepler science conference was held. The discoveries included the median size of planet candidates getting smaller compared to early 2013, preliminary results of the discovery of a few circumbinary planets and planets in the habitable zone. [ 186 ] 2014 [ edit ] Histogram of exoplanet discoveries. The yellow shaded bar shows newly announced planets including those verified by the multiplicity technique (February 26, 2014). On February 13, over 530 additional planet candidates were announced residing around single planet systems. Several of them were nearly Earth-sized and located in the habitable zone. This number was further increased by about 400 in June 2014. [ 187 ] On February 26, scientists announced that data from Kepler had confirmed the existence of 715 new exoplanets. A new statistical method of confirmation was used called \"verification by multiplicity\" which is based on how many planets around multiple stars were found to be real planets. This allowed much quicker confirmation of numerous candidates which are part of multiplanetary systems. 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water . [ 99 ] [ 188 ] [ 189 ] [ 190 ] In March, a study found that small planets with orbital periods of less than one day are usually accompanied by at least one additional planet with orbital period of 1–50 days. This study also noted that ultra-short period planets are almost always smaller than 2 Earth radii unless it is a misaligned hot Jupiter. [ 191 ] On April 17, the Kepler team announced the discovery of Kepler-186f , the first nearly Earth-sized planet located in the habitable zone. This planet orbits around a red dwarf. [ 192 ] In May 2014, K2 observations fields 0 to 13 were announced and described in detail. [ 116 ] K2 observations began in June 2014. In July 2014, the first discoveries from K2 field data were reported in the form of eclipsing binaries . Discoveries were derived from a Kepler engineering data set which was collected prior to campaign 0 [ 193 ] in preparation to the main K2 mission. [ 194 ] On September 23, 2014, NASA reported that the K2 mission had completed campaign 1, [ 195 ] the first official set of science observations, and that campaign 2 [ 196 ] was underway. [ 197 ] Kepler observed KSN 2011b, a Type Ia supernova , in the process of exploding: before, during and after. [ 198 ] Campaign 3 [ 199 ] lasted from November 14, 2014, to February 6, 2015, and included \"16,375 standard long cadence and 55 standard short cadence targets\". [ 116 ] 2015 [ edit ] This section is in list format but may read better as prose . You can help by converting this section , if appropriate. Editing help is available. ( March 2023 ) In January 2015, the number of confirmed Kepler planets exceeded 1000. At least two ( Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b ) of the discovered planets announced that month were likely rocky and in the habitable zone . [ 40 ] Also in January 2015, NASA reported that five confirmed sub-earth-sized rocky exoplanets , all smaller than the planet Venus , were found orbiting the 11.2 billion year old star Kepler-444 , making this star system, at 80% of the age of the universe , the oldest yet discovered. [ 200 ] [ 201 ] [ 202 ] In April 2015, campaign 4 [ 203 ] was reported to last between February 7, 2015, and April 24, 2015, and to include observations of nearly 16,000 target stars and two notable open star clusters, Pleiades and Hyades. [ 204 ] In May 2015, Kepler observed a newly discovered supernova , KSN 2011b ( Type 1a ), before, during and after explosion. Details of the pre-nova moments may help scientists better understand dark energy . [ 198 ] On July 24, 2015, NASA announced the discovery of Kepler-452b , a confirmed exoplanet that is near-Earth in size and found orbiting the habitable zone of a Sun-like star. [ 205 ] [ 206 ] The seventh Kepler planet candidate catalog was released, containing 4,696 candidates, and increase of 521 candidates since the previous catalog release in January 2015. [ 207 ] [ 208 ] On September 14, 2015, astronomers reported unusual light fluctuations of KIC 8462852 , an F-type main-sequence star in the constellation Cygnus , as detected by Kepler, while searching for exoplanets . Various hypotheses have been presented, including comets , asteroids , and an alien civilization . [ 209 ] [ 210 ] [ 211 ] 2016 [ edit ] By May 10, 2016, the Kepler mission had verified 1,284 new planets. [ 41 ] Based on their size, about 550 could be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone : Kepler-560b , Kepler-705b , Kepler-1229b , Kepler-1410b , Kepler-1455b , Kepler-1544 b , Kepler-1593b , Kepler-1606b , and Kepler-1638b . [ 41 ] Data releases [ edit ] The Kepler team originally promised to release data within one year of observations. [ 212 ] However, this plan was changed after launch, with data being scheduled for release up to three years after its collection. [ 213 ] This resulted in considerable criticism, [ 214 ] [ 215 ] [ 216 ] [ 217 ] [ 218 ] leading the Kepler science team to release the third quarter of their data one year and nine months after collection. [ 219 ] The data through September 2010 (quarters 4, 5, and 6) was made public in January 2012. [ 220 ] Follow-ups by others [ edit ] Periodically, the Kepler team releases a list of candidates ( Kepler Objects of Interest , or KOIs) to the public. Using this information, a team of astronomers collected radial velocity data using the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph to confirm the existence of the candidate KOI-428b in 2010, later named Kepler-40b . [ 221 ] In 2011, the same team confirmed candidate KOI-423b, later named Kepler-39b . [ 222 ] Citizen scientist participation [ edit ] Since December 2010, Kepler mission data has been used for the Planet Hunters project, which allows volunteers to look for transit events in the light curves of Kepler images to identify planets that computer algorithms might miss. [ 223 ] By June 2011, users had found sixty-nine potential candidates that were previously unrecognized by the Kepler mission team. [ 224 ] The team has plans to publicly credit amateurs who spot such planets. In January 2012, the BBC program Stargazing Live aired a public appeal for volunteers to analyse Planethunters.org data for potential new exoplanets. This led two amateur astronomers—one in Peterborough , England—to discover a new Neptune -sized exoplanet, to be named Threapleton Holmes B. [ 225 ] One hundred thousand other volunteers were also engaged in the search by late January, analyzing over one million Kepler images by early 2012. [ 226 ] One such exoplanet, PH1b (or Kepler-64b from its Kepler designation), was discovered in 2012. A second exoplanet, PH2b (Kepler-86b) was discovered in 2013. In April 2017, ABC Stargazing Live , a variation of BBC Stargazing Live , launched the Zooniverse project \"Exoplanet Explorers\". While Planethunters.org worked with archived data, Exoplanet Explorers used recently downlinked data from the K2 mission. On the first day of the project, 184 transit candidates were identified that passed simple tests. On the second day, the research team identified a star system, later named K2-138 , with a Sun-like star and four super-Earths in a tight orbit. In the end, volunteers helped to identify 90 exoplanet candidates. [ 227 ] [ 228 ] The citizen scientists that helped discover the new star system will be added as co-authors in the research paper when published. [ 229 ] Confirmed exoplanets [ edit ] Main article: List of exoplanets discovered by the Kepler space telescope Main article: List of planets observed during Kepler's K2 mission See also: List of exoplanetary host stars and List of exoplanets Confirmed small exoplanets in habitable zones ( Kepler-62e , Kepler-62f , Kepler-186f , Kepler-296e , Kepler-296f , Kepler-438b , Kepler-440b , Kepler-442b ). [ 40 ] Exoplanets discovered using Kepler 's data, but confirmed by outside researchers, include Kepler-39b, [ 222 ] Kepler-40b, [ 221 ] Kepler-41b , [ 230 ] Kepler-43b , [ 231 ] Kepler-44b , [ 232 ] Kepler-45b , [ 233 ] as well as the planets orbiting Kepler-223 [ 234 ] and Kepler-42 . [ 235 ] The \"KOI\" acronym indicates that the star is a K epler O bject of I nterest . Kepler Input Catalog [ edit ] Main article: Kepler Input Catalog The Kepler Input Catalog is a publicly searchable database of roughly 13.2 million targets used for the Kepler Spectral Classification Program and the Kepler mission. [ 236 ] [ 237 ] The catalog alone is not used for finding Kepler targets, because only a portion of the listed stars (about one-third of the catalog) can be observed by the spacecraft. [ 236 ] Solar System observations [ edit ] Kepler has been assigned an observatory code ( C55 ) in order to report its astrometric observations of small Solar System bodies to the Minor Planet Center . In 2013 the alternative NEOKepler mission was proposed, a search for near-Earth objects , in particular potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs). Its unique orbit and larger field of view than existing survey telescopes allow it to look for objects inside Earth's orbit. It was predicted a 12-month survey could make a significant contribution to the hunt for PHAs as well as potentially locating targets for NASA's Asteroid Redirect Mission . [ 238 ] Kepler's first discovery in the Solar System, however, was (506121) 2016 BP 81 , a 200-kilometer cold classical Kuiper belt object located beyond the orbit of Neptune . [ 239 ] Retirement [ edit ] Artwork commissioned by NASA to commemorate the retirement of Kepler in October–November 2018. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] On October 30, 2018, NASA announced that the Kepler space telescope, having run out of fuel, and after nine years of service and the discovery of over 2,600 exoplanets , has been officially retired, and will maintain its current, safe orbit, away from Earth. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The spacecraft was deactivated with a \"goodnight\" command sent from the mission's control center at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics on November 15, 2018. [ 240 ] Kepler's retirement coincides with the 388th anniversary of Johannes Kepler 's death in 1630.
